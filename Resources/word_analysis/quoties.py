life except in your mind let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself happiness is not the absence of problems it's the ability to deal with them the man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams encourage your ideas support your ambitions and bring out the best in you sometimes life knocks you on your ass get up get up get up happiness is not the absence of problems it's the ability to deal with them do what you love love what you do and with all your heart give

daily routine can make a big difference to your life always remember people who have helped you along the way and don't forget to lift someone up the biggest wall you have to climb is the one you build in your mind never let your mind talk you out of your dreams trick you into giving up never let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success to get your mind on the right track the rest will follow maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses and start making changes what's done is done what's gone is gone one of life's lessons is always moving on it's okay to look back to see how far you ve come but keep moving forward when in a relationship a real man doesn't make his woman jealous of others he makes others jealous of his woman never stop dreaming never stop believing never give up never stop trying and never stop learning strong people have a strong sense of self worth and self awareness they don't need the approval of others when the going gets tough put one foot in front of the other and just keep going don't give up stop giving other people the power to control your happiness your mind and your life if you don't take control of yourself and your own life someone else is bound to try at the end of the day let there be no excuses no explanations no regrets we all make mistakes have struggles and even regret things in our past but you are not your mistakes you are not your struggles and you are here now with the power to shape your day and your future if you have a strong purpose in life you don't have to be pushed your passion will drive you there patience is not the ability to wait patience is not the ability to wait patience is to be calm no matter what happens constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting although the world is full of suffering it is full also of the overcoming of it you must learn to let go release the stress you were never in control anyway i will not try to convince you to love me to respect me to commit to me i deserve better than that i am better than that goodbye whatever the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve circumstances are the rulers of the weak they are but the instruments of the wise make a pact with yourself today to not be defined by your past sometimes the greatest thing to come out of all your hard work isn't what you get for it but what you become for it shake things up today be you be free share the strongest people find the courage and caring to help others even if they are going through their own storm however mean your life is meet it and live it do not shun it and call it hard names it is not so bad as you are it looks poorest when you are richest the fault finder will find faults even in paradise love your life poor as it is you may perhaps have some pleasant thrilling glorious hours even in a poorhouse the setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode the snow melts before its door as early in the spring i do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there and have as cheering thoughts as in a palace action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action do not let arrogance go to your head and despair to your heart do not let compliments go to your head and criticisms to your heart do not let success go to your head and failure to your heart you are unique you have different talents and abilities you don't have to always follow in the footsteps of others and most important you should always remind yourself that you don't have to do what everyone else is doing and have a responsibility to develop the talents you have been given you cannot change anyone but you can be the reason someone changes each day brings new opportunities allowing you to constantly live with love be there for others bring a little light into someone's day be grateful and live each day to the fullest the surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them courage is feeling fear not getting rid of fear and taking action in the face of fear do not stop thinking of life as an adventure you have no security unless you can live bravely excitingly imaginatively unless you can choose a challenge instead of competence to have what you have never had you have to do what you have never done live the life of your dreamswhen you start living the life of your dreams there will always be obstacles doubters mistakes and setbacks along the way but with hard work perseverance and self belief there is no limit to what you can achieve if you hang out with chickens you re going to cluck and if you hang out with eagles you re going to fly you are the master of your attitudeyou cannot control what happens to you but you can control the way you think about all the events you always have a choice you can choose to face them with a positive mental attitude you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are i don't believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can't find them make them get off the scale you are beautiful your beauty just like your capacity for life happiness and success is immeasurable day after day countless people across the globe get on a scale in search of validation of beauty and social acceptance get off the scale i have yet to see a scale that can tell you how enchanting your eyes are i have yet to see a scale that can show you how wonderful your hair looks when the sun shines its glorious rays on it i have yet to see a scale that can thank you for your compassion sense of humor and contagious smile get off the scale because i have yet to see one that can admire you for your perseverance when challenged in life it's true the scale can only give you a numerical reflection of your relationship with gravity that's it it cannot measure beauty talent purpose life force possibility strength or love don't give the scale more power than it has

never thought possible you have to accept whatever comes and the only important thing is that you meet it with the best you have to give only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible law 4 always say less than necessary when you are trying to impress people with words the more you say the more common you appear and the less in control even if you are saying something banal it will seem original if you make it vague open ended and sphinxlike powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less the more you say the more likely you are to say something foolish i want to live my life in such a way that when i get out of bed in the morning the devil says aw shit he's up in the end you have to choose whether or not to trust someone don't wish it were easier wish you were better great leaders create more leaders not followers if you don't give up on something you truly believe in you will find a way one of the most spiritual things you can do is embrace your humanity connect with those around you today say i love you i m sorry i appreciate you i m proud of you whatever you re feeling send random texts write a cute note embrace your truth and share it cause a smile today for someone else and give plenty of hugs don't fear failure not failure but low aim is the crime in great attempts it is glorious even to fail don't confuse poor decision making with destiny own your mistakes it's ok we all make them learn from them so they can empower you how would your life be different if you stopped allowing other people to dilute or poison your day with their words or opinions let today be the day you stand strong in the truth of your beauty and journey through your day without attachment to the validation of others turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback even if he deserves it don't allow his anger to become your anger be the positive impact on the lives of others dreams don't work unless you take action the surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them why not you today many will awaken with a fresh sense of inspiration why not you today many will open their eyes to the beauty that surrounds them why not you today many will choose to leave the ghost of yesterday behind and seize the immeasurable power of today why not you today many will break through the barriers of the past by looking at the blessings of the present why not you today for many the burden of self doubt and insecurity will be lifted by the security and confidence of empowerment why not you today many will rise above their believed limitations and make contact with their powerful innate strength why not you today many will choose to live in such a manner that they will be a positive role model for their children why not you today many will choose to free themselves from the personal imprisonment of their bad habits why not you today many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness why not you today many will find abundance in simplicity why not you today many will be confronted by difficult moral choices and they will choose to do what is right instead of what is beneficial why not you today many will decide to no longer sit back with a victim mentality but to take charge of their lives and make positive changes why not you today many will take the action necessary to make a difference why not you today many will make the commitment to be a better mother father son daughter student teacher worker boss brother sister so much more why not you today is a new day many will seize this day many will live it to the fullest why not you it takes sunshine and rain to make a rainbow there would be no rainbows without sunshine and rain let today be the day you stop being haunted by the ghost of yesterday holding a grudge harboring anger resentment is poison to the soul get even with people but not those who have hurt us forget them instead get even with those who have helped us i cannot let the fear of the past color the future remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist be curious and however difficult life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at it matters that you don't just give up rejection is an opportunity for your selection it doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down all that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down it doesn't matter what you did or where you were it matters where you are and what you re doing get out there sing the song in your heart and never let anyone shut you up failure is a bend in the road not the end of the road learn from failure and keep moving forward it takes guts and humility to admit mistakes admitting we re wrong is courage not weakness discipline your mind to think positively discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event don't wait for the right moment to start start and make each moment right the most important step a man can take it's not the first one is it it's the next one always the next step dalinar time is an equal opportunity employer each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day rich people can't buy more hours scientists can't invent new minutes and you can't save time to spend it on another day even so time is amazingly fair and forgiving no matter how much time you ve wasted in the past you still have an entire tomorrow what you stay focused on will grow don't wait for things to happen make them happen you learn something valuable from all of the significant events and people but you never touch your true potential until you challenge yourself to go beyond imposed limitations be silent and safe silence never betrays you be true to your word and your work and your friend put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you nor judge of a road till it draw to the end first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do challenge and adversity are meant to help you know who you are storms hit your weakness but unlock your true strength gratitude builds a bridge to abundance the universe doesn't give you what you ask for with your thoughts it gives you what you demand with your actions perfectly imperfectwe have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey and while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path they are on the same journey but each takes a different path along this gravity driven journey some snowflakes collide and damage each other some collide and join together some are influenced by wind there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake but no matter what the transition the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey i find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration one of these parallels is of snowflakes and us we too are all headed in the same direction we are being driven by a universal force to the same destination we are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey we sometimes bump into each other we cross paths we become altered we take different physical forms but at all times we too are 100 perfectly imperfect at every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey i m not perfect for your journey and you re not perfect for my journey but i m perfect for my journey and you re perfect for your journey we re heading to the same place we re taking different routes but we re both exactly perfect the way we are think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake like you they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you they have taken the perfect form for their journey how strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey stop doing what is easy start doing what is right changing your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person the real personal change can only happen from the inside out if you firstly create the change within yourself you can turn your life around 7 effective ways to make others feel important 1 use their name 2 express sincere gratitude 3 do more listening than talking 4 talk more about them than about you 5 be authentically interested 6 be sincere in your praise 7 show you care my past has not defined me destroyed me deterred me or defeated me it has only strengthened me plant seeds of happiness hope success and love it will all come back to you in abundance this is the law of nature one resolution i have made and try always to keep is this to rise above little things the one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried do not fear failure but rather fear not trying it's important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences you have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too nurture your mind with positive thoughts kindness empathy compassion peace love joy humility generosity etc the more you feed your mind with positive thoughts the more you can attract great things into your life when things do not go your way remember that every challenge every adversity contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth good people see the good and bring out the best in other people make the most of the best and the best of the worst and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving you were put on this earth to achieve your greatest self to live out your purpose and to do it courageously beliefs are choices first you choose your beliefs then your beliefs affect your choices you were born to stand out stop trying to fit in you are essentially who you create yourself to be and all that occurs in your life is the result of your own making people who lack the clarity courage or determination to follow their own dreams will often find ways to discourage yours when you change for the better the people around you will be inspired to change also but only after doing their best to make you stop live your truth and don't ever stop life is short focus on what really matters most you have to change your priorities over time the reason many people in our society are miserable sick and highly stressed is because of an unhealthy attachment to things they have no control over it doesn't matter if a million people tell you what you can't do or if ten million tell you no if you get one yes from god that's all you need great leaders can see the greatness in others when they can't see it themselves and lead them to their highest potential they don't even know change may not always bring growth but there is no growth without change surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dreamsdistance yourself from negative people who try to lower your motivation and decrease your ambition create space for positive people to come into your life surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dreams encourage your ideas support your ambitions and bring out the best in you always believe in yourself and always stretch yourself beyond your limits your life is worth a lot more than you think because you are capable of accomplishing more than you know you have more potential than you think but you will never know your full potential unless you keep challenging yourself and pushing beyond your own self imposed limits when you take control of your attitude you take control of your life stop doing what is easy or popular start doing what is right to learn something new you need to try new things and not be afraid to be wrong one of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important enthusiasm can help you find the new doors but it takes passion to open them if you have a strong purpose in life you don't have to be pushed your passion will drive you there law 46never appear too perfectappearing better than others is always dangerous but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses envy creates silent enemies it is smart to occasionally display defects and admit to harmless vices in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity let go of something old that no longer serves you in order to make room for something new the comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar safe at ease and secure you never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone law 25re create yourselfdo not accept the roles that society foists on you re create yourself by forging a new identity one that commands attention and never bores the audience be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life want to keep christ in christmas feed the hungry clothe the naked forgive the guilty welcome the unwanted care for the ill love your enemies and do unto others as you would have done unto you this life is for loving sharing learning smiling caring forgiving laughing hugging helping dancing wondering healing and even more loving i choose to live life this way i want to live my life in such a way that when i get out of bed in the morning the devil says aw shit he's up you are not a victim no matter what you have been through you re still here you may have been challenged hurt betrayed beaten and discouraged but nothing has defeated you you are still here you have been delayed but not denied you are not a victim you are a victor you have a history of victory the right thing to do and the hard thing to do are usually the same consistency is the true foundation of trust either keep your promises or do not make them it's funny how in this journey of life even though we may begin at different times and places our paths cross with others so that we may share our love compassion observations and hope this is a design of god that i appreciate and cherish i cannot compromise my respect for your love you can keep your love i will keep my respect shine your light and make a positive impact on the world there is nothing so honorable as helping improve the lives of others everything is hard before it is easydream your own dreams achieve your own goals your journey is your own and unique great leaders create more leadersgood leaders have vision and inspire others to help them turn vision into reality great leaders create more leaders not followers great leaders have vision share vision and inspire others to create their own fear robs you of your freedom to make the right choice in life that can bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be on the other side of fear lies freedom if you want to grow you need to be brave and take risks if you re not uncomfortable you re not growing the discontent and frustration that you feel is entirely your own creation be with someone who inspires you and makes you be the best version of yourself the greatest step towards a life of simplicity is to learn to let go life teaches us the right path is rarely the easy one the harder you fall the heavier your heart the heavier your heart the stronger you climb the stronger you climb the higher your pedestal no one has ever achieved greatness without dreams failures are the stairs we climb to reach success every choice comes with a consequence once you make a choice you must accept responsibility you cannot escape the consequences of your choices whether you like them or not keep in mind that the true measure of an individual is how he treats a person who can do him absolutely no good difficulties and adversities viciously force all their might on us and cause us to fall apart but they are necessary elements of individual growth and reveal our true potential we have got to endure and overcome them and move forward never lose hope storms make people stronger and never last forever stay strong stay positive and never give up how much you can learn when you fail determines how far you will go into achieving your goals find a purpose to serve not a lifestyle to live live boldly push yourself don't settle you can have everything you want if you can put your heart and soul into everything you do free yourself from the complexities and drama of your life simplify look within within ourselves we all have the gifts and talents we need to fulfill the purpose we ve been blessed with create a vision for the life you really want and then work relentlessly towards making it a reality change course but don't give up how would your life be different if you stopped worrying about things you can't control and started focusing on the things you can let today be the day you free yourself from fruitless worry seize the day and take effective action on things you can change those with a grateful mindset tend to see the message in the mess and even though life may knock them down the grateful find reasons if even small ones to get up no matter how much experience you have there's always something new you can learn and room for improvement today is a new day don't let your history interfere with your destiny let today be the day you stop being a victim of your circumstances and start taking action towards the life you want you have the power and the time to shape your life break free from the poisonous victim mentality and embrace the truth of your greatness you were not meant for a mundane or mediocre life after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet sparkling with color bountiful with life within decades we must close our eyes again isn't it a noble an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it this is how i answer when i am asked as i am surprisingly often why i bother to get up in the mornings be where you are stop over thinking and focus on what you are doing do not let your negative thoughts have power over you because those thoughts will end up controlling your life no one can live a positive life with a negative mind if you care about something enough you ll find a way to make it happen if you have a goal write it down if you do not write it down you do not have a goal you have a wish war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth a war is much worse when a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master such war degrades a people a war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good and which is their own war carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice is often the means of their regeneration a man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself as long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind human beings must be willing when need is to do battle for the one against the other law 38think as you like but behave like othersif you make a show of going against the times flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them they will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior it is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness there is great change to be experienced once you learn the power of letting go stop allowing anyone or anything to control limit repress or discourage you from being your true self today is yours to shape own it break free from people and things that poison or dilute your spirit there is no more profitable investment than investing in yourself it is the best investment you can make you can never go wrong with it it is the true way to improve yourself to be the best version of you and lets you be able to best serve those around you to overcome fear is the quickest way to gain your self confidence you are never alone you are eternally connected with everyone believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let self doubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for one must always be prepared for riotous and endless waves of transformation your complaints your drama your victim mentality your whining your blaming and all of your excuses have never gotten you even a single step closer to your goals or dreams let go of your nonsense let go of the delusion that you deserve better and go earn it today is a new day instead of worrying about what could go wrong change your thoughts to what could go right when you change the negative thought into a positive one it eliminates the negative one what helps you persevere is your resilience and commitment you make the world a better place by making daily improvements to become the best version of yourself if you believe you can you might if you know you can you will be careful the stories you re telling yourself about your current circumstances a head full of negative thoughts has no space for positive ones every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow the challenge of life is intended to make you better not bitter  yelling doesn't make a thing any more possible when you concentrate your energy purposely on the future possibility that you aspire to realize your energy is passed on to it and makes it attracted to you with a force stronger than the one you directed towards it it's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives it's what we do consistently plants are more courageous than almost all human beings an orange tree would rather die than produce lemons whereas instead of dying the average person would rather be someone they are not you attract who you are being when you work at being the type of person that you want to attract you attract those kinds of people into your life great goals make great people people cannot hit what they do not aim for if you ve got nothing to dance about find a reason to sing there are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone it is impossible to discourage the real writers they don't give a damn what you say they re going to write make today worth remembering a gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do but what he should do one of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important most people enjoy those rare moments when others make them feel important it is one of the deepest human desires make the most of what you have and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving you have come a long way and have won many battles whenever you re faced with a difficult or challenging situation you ll overcome it yes you can act the way you d like to be and soon you ll be the way you d like to act you have two choices to conquer your fear or to let your fear conquer you make your work to be in keeping with your purposepeople who lack the clarity courage or determination to follow their own dreams will often find ways to discourage yours live your truth and don't ever stop don't chase people be yourself do your own thing and work hard the right people the ones who really belong in your life will come to your and stay real change is difficult at the beginning without the familiar to rely upon you may not in as much command as you had once been when things are not going your way you will start doubting yourself stay positive keep the faith and keep moving forward your breakthrough may be just around the corner life keeps throwing me lemons because i make the best lemonade protect your enthusiasm from the negativity and fear of others never decide to do nothing just because you can only do little do what you can you would be surprised at what little acts have done for our world your greatest self has been waiting your whole life don't make it wait any longer too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears keep your promises and be consistent be the kind of person others can trust instead of complaining about the problem and blaming others start finding the solution we all have negative thoughts now and then but we can choose not to dwell there and not to let them control us maybe i made a mistake yesterday but yesterday's me is still me i am who i am today with all my faults tomorrow i might be a tiny bit wiser and that's me too these faults and mistakes are what i am making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life i have come to love myself for who i was who i am and who i hope to become if you fuel your journey on the opinions of others you are going to run out of gas the most intriguing people you will encounter in this life are the people who had insights about you that you didn't know about yourself learn everything you can anytime you can from anyone you can there will always come a time when you will be grateful you did faith moves mountains love transforms hearts sometimes letting go is simply changing the labels you place on an event looking at the same event with fresh eyes create your own miracles do what you think you cannot do our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be push yourself to do more and to experience more harness your energy to start expanding your dreams yes expand your dreams don't accept a life of mediocrity when you hold such infinite potential within the fortress of your mind dare to tap into your greatness if you are not the hero of your own story then you re missing the whole point of your humanity a young outcast will often feel that there is something wrong with himself but as he gets older grows more confident in who he is he will adapt he will begin to feel that there is something wrong with everyone else sometimes it's worth lingering on the journey for a while before getting to the destination what the mind can conceive and believe and the heart desire you can achieve integrity is doing what is right and truthful and doing as you say you would do we have been called to heal wounds to unite what has fallen apart and to bring home those who have lost their way love is as simple as the absence of self given to another god when invited fills

whispering in your heart in the whole existence just tune your ears my atheism like that of spinoza is true piety towards the universe and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image to be servants of their human interests because when we give too many fucks when we choose to give a fuck about everything then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times that's when life fucks us remember that trying is eighty percent of doing something so try and don't give up because not giving up is the other twenty percent i am not a victim no matter what i have been through i m still here i have a history of victory a photograph shouldn't be just a picture it should be a philosophy happiness is a state of mind a choice a way of living it is not something to be achieved it is something to be experienced the more you believed in yourself the more you could trust yourself the more you trust yourself the less you compare yourself to others and worse i may be yet the worst is notso long as we can say this is the worst how would your life be different if you didn't allow yourself to be defined by your past let today be the day you stop letting your history interfere with your destiny and awaken to the opportunity to release your greatest self just for the record happiness is not bullshit most people fail in life not because they aim too high and miss but because they aim too low and hit the more you talk about them the more important they will feel the more you listen to them the more important you will make them feel if you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams if you can't believe in miracles then believe in yourself when you want something bad enough let that drive push you to make it happen sometimes you ll run into brick walls that are put there to test you find a way around them and stay focused on your dream where there's a will there's a way real change is difficult at the beginning but gorgeous at the end change begins the moment you get the courage and step outside your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone sometimes when people have a low opinion of their own worth or perhaps when they refuse responsibility for their lives they choose a new acquaintance of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past such people don't believe that they deserve any better so they don't go looking for it or perhaps they don't want the trouble of better freud called this a repetition compulsion when was the last time you woke up and realized that today could be the best day of your life how would your life be different if you were conscious about the food you ate the people you surround yourself with and the media you watch listen to or read let today be the day you pay attention to what you feed your mind your body and your life create a nourishing environment conducive to your growth and well being today what is the point of being on this earth if you are going to be like everyone else if a man has his eyes bound you can encourage him as much as you like to stare through the bandage but he ll never see anything accept yourself your strengths your weaknesses your truths and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose until you change how you get things done you ll never know what works best the scientist does not study nature because it is useful to do so he studies it because he takes pleasure in it and he takes pleasure in it because it is beautiful if nature were not beautiful it would not be worth knowing and life would not be worth living i am not speaking of course of the beauty which strikes the senses of the beauty of qualities and appearances i am far from despising this but it has nothing to do with science what i mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts and which a pure intelligence can grasp your beliefs affect your choices your choices shape your actions your actions determine your results the future you create depends upon the choices you make and the actions you take today dedicate yourself to what gives your life true meaning and purpose make a positive difference in someone's life once your mindset changes everything on the outside will change along with it either you run the day or the day runs you finding the lesson behind every adversity will be the one important thing that helps get you through it remember that things are not always as they appear to be curiosity creates possibilities and opportunities stop blaming outside circumstances for your inside chaos thank you mr secretary general unicef executive director excellencies and distinguished guests from across the world my name is kim nam jun also known as rm the leader of the group bts it's an incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today's young generation last november bts launched the love myselfbeing defeated is often a temporary condition giving up is what makes it permanent you make mistakes mistakes don't make youthe greatest revenge is massive success you have to lift a person up before you can really put them in their place your own setbacks aren't what they first appear to be rather than viewing them as failures view them as learning opportunities that are the building blocks for future preparation live out of your imagination instead of out of your memory  someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality when we mentally give a person place or point in time more credit than ourselves we create a fictitious ceiling a restriction over the expectations that we have over our own performance in that moment we get tense we focus on the outcome instead of the activity and we miss the doing of the deed we either think the world depends on the result or it's too good to be true but it doesn't and it isn't and it's not our right to believe it does or is don't create imaginary constraints a leading role a blue ribbon a winning score a great idea the love of our life euphoric bliss who are we to think we don't deserve these fortunes when they re in our grasp who are we to think we haven't earned them if we stay and process within ourselves in the joy of the doing we will never choke at the finish line why because we re not thinking of the finish line we re not looking at the clock we re not watching ourselves on the jumbotron performing we are performing in real time where the approach is the destination align yourself with people that you can learn from people who want more out of life people who are stretching and searching and seeking some higher ground in life sometimes we forget about our own advantages because we focus on what we don't have just because you have to work a little harder at something that seems easier to others doesn't mean you re without your own talents never say anything about yourself you don't want to come truemake the choice to embrace this day do not let your today be stolen by the ghost of yesterday or the to do list of tomorrow it's inspiring to see all the wonderfully amazing things that can happen in a day in which you participate it is difficult to make the right choice if you fear choosing wrongly shoot for the moon because even if you miss you miss you ll land in the stars the most powerful magic of all is choice sex is a powerful intent to create the creation of pleasure creation of love and ultimately the creation of life it connects and syncs two beings emotionally physically and mentally and is one of the strongest expressions of love that exists in this world just because fate doesn't deal you the right cards it doesn't mean you should give up it just means you have to play the cards you get to their maximum potential what others think about you is none of your business do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions never let fear hold you captive never let self doubt hold you captive never let frustration hold you captive goals are the road maps that guide you to your destination cultivate the habit of setting clearly defined written goals they are the road maps that guide you to your destination people are successful because they think and act like successful people it's a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration those emotions are poison to any living goal seize the wind i whispered don't become the kite that never flies stop comparing yourself to others always strive to improve yourself to become better today than you were yesterday to serve those around you and the world always remember to take your vitamins take your vitamin a for action vitamin b for belief vitamin c for confidence vitamin d for discipline vitamin e for enthusiasm focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible everything is within your power and your power is within you don't let the tall weeds cast a shadow on the beautiful flowers in your garden for your past for your flaws and ultimately for your stress i judge no one whom i ve met along the way because in a sense we were all wounded in our own ways simplify your life you don't grow spiritual you shrink spiritual a great tree develops over time and can tell stories not only those of happiness but also those that contain pain from what it has seen over the years and as a result is the wise ancient tree that it is today as the seasons change the tree naturally goes through changes as well where the leaves turn yellow and orange in the fall falling by the winter returning in the spring and with full set of new leafs by the summer love is no different in that there will be times when we are fully naked in the winter and left to wonder about spring when it seemed so easy to love yet the wise tree knows that no winter will last forever no matter how cold it may be never underestimate the power you have to take your life in a new direction we become so absorbed in our flaws and faults that we forget that it is better to be a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without to have flaws is beauty in itself a fact so frightening that we hurry to hide them from sight and tarnish the whole in the process of comparing ourselves to others as i naturally go through a full range of emotions in my life i mustn't feel ashamed for feeling lost for it is honest and human to feel such in traveling a companion in life compassion she repeats making sure of it if she had paper and pencil it wouldn't surprise me if she wrote it down so what does that really mean in simple terms i think it over it takes me a while to gather my thoughts but she waits patiently i think it means i say that chance encounters are what keep us going in simple terms people in general would rather die than forgive it's that hard if god said in plain language i m giving you a choice forgive or die a lot of people would go ahead and order their coffin one day in my shoes and a day for me in your shoes the beauty of travel lies in the ease and willingness to be more open some we proudly display on our arms while others we shyly conceal tattoo the moments of sorrow as well as the moments of splendor and beauty tattoo in an acknowledgment and tribute to home and tattooing your beliefs that define who you are whether we intended to or not every moment of our lives are tattooed to our heart perfection does not exist you can always do better and you can always grow whether you know or not you are the infinite potential of love peace and joyyou can lose your money you can lose your friends you can lose your job and you can lose your marriage and still recover as long as there is hope never lose

help the way we re born we can't help what we are only what life we choose to make for ourselves i conclude therefore that fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways so long as the two are in agreement men are successful but unsuccessful when they fall out for my part i consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious because fortune is a woman and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill use her and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly she is therefore always woman like a lover of young men because they are less cautious more violent and with more audacity command her be happy with who you are and what you do and you can do anything you want it's up to you today to start making healthy choices not choices that are just healthy for your body but healthy for your mind although time seems to fly it never travels faster than one day at a time each day is a new

people perish you need a dream if you re going to succeed in anything you do the size of your dreams must always exceed your current capacity to achieve them if your dreams do not scare you they are not big enough a birth date is a reminder to celebrate the life as well as to update the life do more listening than talking talk more about them than about you at school new ideas are thrust at you every day out in the world you ll have to find your inner motivation to seek for new ideas on your own you can't hang around waiting for somebody else to pull your strings destiny's what you make of it you have to face whatever life throws at you and if it throws more than you d like more than you think you can handle well then you just have to find the heroism within yourself and play out the hand you ve been dealt the universe never sets a challenge that can't be met you just need to believe in yourself in order to find the strength to face it if you want to find happiness find gratitude one word of encouragement can be enough to spark someone's motivation to continue with a difficult challenge when you start giving instead of getting you make a difference you can always give a warm smile a sincere hello a positive vibe your attention your time your love and kindness to those around you with a hint of good judgment to fear nothing not failure or suffering or even death indicates

opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions today's a new day manifesting is a lot like making a cake the things needed are supplied by you the mixing is done by your mind and the baking is done in the oven of the universe despite everything it's still you success is a poor teachersoar with wit conquer with dignity handle with care intelligence is more important than strength

truth free yourself from the rules of old judgments and create the space for new understanding fear can only grow in darkness once you face fear with light you win we can't undo a single thing we have ever done but we can make decisions today that propel us to the life we want and towards the healing we need you can't just wish change you have to live the change in order for it to become a reality reading the bible will help you get to know the word but it's when you put it down and live your life that you get to know the author a very small percentage of the people in this world will actually experience and live today so many people will be stuck on another day another time that traumatized them and caused them to spiritually stutter so they miss out on this day i hope you find true meaning contentment and passion in your life i hope you navigate the difficult times and come out with greater strength and resolve i hope you find whatever balance you seek with your eyes wide open

courage to make changes when you can choose to rather than being forced to if you do not make change change will make you to assess the quality of thoughts of people don't listen to their words but watch their actions the value of surrounding yourself with positive people is not what you get from them but how good a person you have become because of them never allow your mind to wander untamed like a wild animal that exists on the basis of survival of the fittest tame your mind with consistent focus on your goals and desires everyone's time is limited what matters most is to focus on what matters most grateful souls focus on the happiness and abundance present in their lives and this in turn attracts more abundance and joy towards them do it first and feel about it afterwards dagny taggartif you don't know exactly where you re going how will you know when you get there shoot for the moon even if you miss you ll land among the stars scholars theologians and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty romance and magic of a relationship built on 100 authenticityit is not as much about who you used to be as it is about who you choose to be life is a balanced system of learning and evolution whether pleasure or pain every situation in your life serves a purpose it is up to us to recognize what that purpose could be a smile is the best way to get oneself out of a tight spot even if it is a fake one surprisingly enough everyone takes it at face value i read that in a book if you keep staring at me i ll hit you i only became part of your team recently when i replaced sasuke so i don't know everything that's going on i don't really understand people either but even i can tell that naruto really loves you naruto's been shouldering that promise for a long time i think he means to shoulder it for the rest of his life i don't know what you said to him but it's just like what's been done to me it feels like a curse sasuke causes naruto pain but i think you do too sasuke is only helping spread his darkness across the world letting him live will only sow the seeds of another war he's just another criminal now sasuke lost all hope of coming back when his group akatsuki attacked our village your fellow konoha shinobi would never accept him now sakura's not stupid either she understands the position he's put us all in that's why she came out here to tell you herself i ll detach myself from the crowd if it hinders my growth i ll fall from the tree that won't let me grow everyone of us needs to show how much we care for each other and in the process care for ourselves do you love yourself enough to be what you love yourself enough to want  by reacting from fear instead of responding from love you inject poison directly into the veins of your relationship one of the most healing things you can do is recognize where in your life you are your own poison when admiring other people's gardens don't forget to tend to your own flowers it is better to aim high and miss than to aim low and hit a friend who is far away is sometimes much nearer than one who is at hand before this generation lose the wisdom one advice read books it's time to care it's time to take responsibility it's time to lead it's time for a change it's time to be true to our greatest self it's time to stop blaming others don't tell me about your god with your words show me about your god with your actions when i face the desolate impossibility of writing five hundred pages a sick sense of failure falls on me and i know i can never do it then gradually i write one page and then another one day's work is all i can permit myself to contemplate how would your life be different if you pretended those around you were deaf to your words let today be the day you let your actions speak and communicate your feelings and intentions are you going to allow the world around you to change while you remain stagnant make this the time you throw away old habits that have hindered your happiness and success and finally allow your greatest self to flourish life itself is simple it's just not easy once you start recognizing the truth of your story finish the story it happened but you re still here you re still capable powerful you re not your circumstance it happened and you made it through you re still fully equipped with every single tool you need to fulfill your purpose you ve been given the innate power to shape your life but you cannot just speak change you have to live change intent paired with action builds the bridge to success you can't just want it you have to do it live it be it success isn't something you have it's something you do when you find yourself in need of spiritual nourishment it is in the opportunities to serve others that you will find the abundance you seek the purpose of fear is to raise your awareness not to stop your progress you are where you are right now because of the actions you ve taken or maybe the inaction you ve taken think of the patience god has had for you and let it resonate to others if you want a more patient world let patience be your mottoyour life begins to change the day you take responsibility for it the whole value of solitude depends upon oneself it may be a sanctuary or a prison a haven of repose or a place of punishment a heaven or a hell as we ourselves make it never be surprised by your own success how would your life be different if you stopped focusing on what you didn't want and started focusing on what you do want let today be the day you establish a clear intent make a plan and take actions towards your intent therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities i have enumerated but it is very necessary to appear to have them and i shall dare to say this also that to have them and always to observe them is injurious and that to appear to have them is useful to appear merciful faithful humane religious upright and to be so but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so you may be able and know how to change to the opposite the moment you become friends with your inner self you realize that the failures or hindrances that you met earlier were caused more by your disconnected status with your inner being the here and now is all we have and if we play it right it's all we ll need politeness is the first thing people lose once they get the power a different vantage point gives us new information and with that information we can begin to change our approach when you are angry try your best to go to sleep it keeps you away from speaking writing and thinking while you are angry kindness is universal sometimes being kind allows others to see the goodness in humanity through you always be kinder than necessary you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great resources are hired to give results not reasons all worries are less with wine your feelings wouldn't get hurt if you were honest with yourselfmost people think the biggest sacrifice the greates act of love you can give is to die for someone and probably it is but sometimes it is the opposite the biggest thing you can do for someone is to live if you have the courage to be honest with everyone including yourself you may hurt a few people's feelings but they will forever value your opinion more than your half truths if only we had the certainty in our strength that we do in our weaknesses and capacity for failure oh how wonderful life would bei promise you nothing is as chaotic as it seems nothing is worth diminishing your health nothing is worth poisoning yourself into stress anxiety and fear stop giving meaningless praise and start giving meaningful action make the most of the best and the least of the worst when you do what you love the seemingly impossible becomes simply challenging the laborious becomes purposeful resistance the difficult loses its edge and is trampled by your progress although i deeply love oceans deserts and other wild landscapes it is only mountains that beckon me with that sort of painful magnetic pull to walk deeper and deeper into their beauty they keep me continuously wanting to know more feel more see more i may not be where i want to be but i m thankful for not being where i used to be you know you re doing what you love when sunday nights feel the same as friday nights stop allowing your day to day life to be clouded by busy nothingness we only live once we all have an expiration date after that we will never come again i am not saying that to make you sad i am saying that so you can cherish each moment in your life and be grateful that you are here and you are speciala person doesn't have to change who he is to become better the value of a moment is immeasurable the power of just one moment can propel you to success and happiness or chain you to failure and misery your agreement with reality defines your life i can't think of anything more disheartening than living a life without a clear purpose change is in the air this change reminds us that we are made and beautifully sculpted by the same power that orchestrates the change of season let this be the season you embrace and align yourself with this change search for contentment in each person you meet if you intend to change decide what you want and live your life accordingly success is something you experience when you act accordingly success is not something you have it's something you do but when your sword breaks you draw your dagger if you do whatever it takes to accomplish your goals to live the life you desire it will be worth it i promise but if you find some excuse to justify quitting your journey you will regret it this is also a promise gbbpeople who don't see you every day have a hard time understanding how on some days good days you can run three miles but can barely walk across the parking lot on other days my mom said quietly i do not care about happiness simply because i believe that joy is something worth fighting for when you establish a destination by defining what you want then take physical action by making choices that move you towards that destination the possibility for success is limitless and arrival at the destination is inevitable the best way to succeed is to have a specific intent a clear vision a plan of action and the ability to maintain clarity those are the four pillars of success it never fails having uncompromising belief also means safeguarding your own spirit defining who and what you want in your life purposeful planning is most effective when you are actively seeking and getting feedback from those whose judgement you trust and respect what would have become of hercules do you think if there had been no lion hydra stag or boar and no savage criminals to rid the world of what would he have done in the absence of such challenges obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep so by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty hercules and even if he had what good would it have done him what would have been the use of those arms that physique and that noble soul without crises or conditions to stir into him action your hopes dreams and aspirations are legitimate they are trying to take you airborne above the clouds above the storms if you only let them wanting something is not enough you must hunger for it your motivation must be absolutely compelling in order to overcome the obstacles that will invariably come your way if you get clear on the what the how will be taken care of people change for two main reasons either their minds have been opened ortheir hearts have been brokendo not sabotage your new relationship with your last relationship's poison maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses in your life you realize everything that happens in life is a result of the previous choice you ve made and start making new choices to change your life you can't learn in school what the world is going to do next year you re never ready for what you have to do you just do it that makes you ready when we replace a sense of service and gratitude with a sense of entitlement and expectation we quickly see the demise of our relationships society and economy discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event discipline your mind to think positively to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event today is yours to shape create a masterpiece live your vision and demand your success whatever choice you make makes you choose wisely live today do not allow your spirit to be softened of your happiness to be limited by a day you cannot have back or a day that does not yet exist your dream is a reality that is waiting for you to materialize today is a new day don't let your history interfere with your destiny learn from your past so that it can empower your present and propel you to greatnessdream big wake up take the first step into the unknown interrupt your thoughts of i should with your action of doing free yourself from the complexities of your life a life of simplicity and happiness awaits you i often wished that more people understood the invisible side of things even the people who seemed to understand didn't really change is the parent of progress success in life is not for those who run fast but for those who keep running and always on the move what do you think will be more effective when it comes to succeeding believing you can or knowing you will let today be the last day you took timid steps of belief and start taking confident steps of purpose driven knowing the first place where self esteem begins its journey is within us today stretches ahead of you waiting to be shaped you are the sculptor who gets to do the shaping what today will be like is up to you make a pact with yourself today to not be defined by your past instead shake things up today live through today don't just exist through it live through it just because you re in a situation doesn't mean you have to be that situation you re not the situation you re in live life with a purpose and live it full out never confuse someone else's inability to do something with its inability to be done i hear you say why always why you see things and you say why but i dream things that never were and i say why not each day offers you an opportunity to overcome obstacles and fears in your life those victories however small they appear are significant and don't need to be measured against or compared with those of someone else they stand on their own as important measures of your own personal capabilities superhuman effort isn't worth a damn unless it achieves results you don't have to be great to get started but you have to to get started to be greattoo many of us are not living our dreams because we are living out fears free yourself from the burden of feeling the need to hold on to anything let go you are a part of everything the comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar safe at ease and secure if you always do what is easy and choose the path of least resistance you never step outside your comfort zone great things don't come from comfort zones learn from your history but don't live in it create not for the money not for the fame not for the recognition but for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it the price tag you put on yourself decides your worth underestimating yourself will cost you dearly the only easy day was yesterday the beginning is always now you cannot continue on the same path and arrive at a different destination make the choice to have your actions reflect your goals all my problems bow before my stubbornness you need mountains long staircases don't make good hikers start shaping your own day start walking your own walk this journey is yours take charge of it stop giving other people the power to shape your life sometimes you re drowning yourself in your own words a lack of clarity could put the brakes on any journey to success when you truly embrace your human impermanence you connect with the power you have and influence you have over the time you have too much action with too little intent makes for wasteful exertion of energy and the confusion between movement and progress let today be the day you stop having conflict between your actions and your goals and finally align your greatest intent with your purposeful actions creating a universal symphony serenading your success as with all other aspects of the narrative art you will improve with practice but practice will never make you perfect why should it what fun would that be never run from the truth it is always there it never changes save your energy it is not enough if you just live life as it comes to you like a floating leaf in a pond make use of the powers bestowed in you and soar like an eagle don't be one of those who don't want others to be empowered share information try to make the next person smarter no matter what the cause god is only as willing as you are success can be defined in many ways but failure in only one quitting there is no tomorrow and there was no yesterday if you truly want to accomplish your goals you must engulf yourself in today there's only one thing that will make them stop hating you and that's being so good at what you do that they can't ignore you i ve learned that no matter how inspired fired up and motivated you might be the dark clouds will always set into be is to do just like your body and lifestyle can be healthy or unhealthy the same is true with your beliefs your beliefs can be your medicine or your poison if you are going to be successful you need to give up the phrase i can't all of its cousins such as i wish i were able to the key to success is actionif people just took it a day at a time they d be a lot happier accepting personal responsibility for your life frees you from outside influences increases your self esteem boosts confidence in your ability to decisions and ultimately leads to achieve success in life persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel concerned but not consumed although goals are important having a plan of action is vital to the success of those goals having a goal with no plan of action is like wanting to travel to a new destination without having a map the road to success is always under construction the lust for comfort kills the passions of the soul if everyone is moving forward together then success takes care of itself do not compromise yourself and put your goodness in the same impermanent category as whatever circumstance happening be the best you in every circumstance if it is bread that you seek you will have bread if it is the soul you seek you will find the soul if you understand this secret you know you are that which you seek you don't have to be a hero to accomplish great things to compete you can just be an ordinary chap sufficiently motivated to reach challenging goals free yourself from the inauthenticity and disempowerment of your story have you had a failure or rejection you could get bitter that's one way to deal with it or you could just get better what do you think step out of your comfort zone comfort zones where your unrealized dreams are buried are the enemies of achievement leadership begins when you step outside your comfort zone we are mathematical equations where your life is the sum of all choices you ve made until now the good news is you can change the equation so that you start making a difference in your life it's not what you ve got it's what you use that makes a difference leave your excuses and live your dreams pride and power fall when the person falls but discoveries of truth form legacies that can be built upon for generations action is the universal language of success a person today who seems to have a great sense of self esteem has his or her childhood days to thank for it god didn't give fear a body god gave love a body when you start something make sure that you re willing to take the time to finish it right because honey the work you put into it will be more than worth it in the end the best things always are despite what you may believe you can disappoint people and still be good enough you can make mistakes and still be capable and talented you can let people down and still be worthwhile and deserving of love everyone has disappointed someone they care about everyone messes up lets people down and makes mistakes not because we re inadequate or fundamentally inept but because we re imperfect and fundamentally human expecting anything different is setting yourself up for failure the only thing wrong with trying to please everyone is that there's always at least one person who will remain unhappy you the only way you re going to reach places you ve never gone is if you trust god's direction to do things you ve never done you must take responsibility for removing i can't from your vocabulary if you can remember why you started then you will know why you must continue in the face of adversity we have a choice we can be bitter or we can be better those words are my north star being in home is like magic moments in a magic world among maiciansthe greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken but those in which it is acted upon do not dilute the truth of your potential we often convince ourselves that we cannot change that we cannot overcome the circumstances of our lives that is simply not true you have been blessed with immeasurable power to make positive changes in your life but you can't just wish it you can't just hope it you can't just want it you have to live it be it do it without desires and dreams your thoughts do not matter and you can think whatever you want to too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a listening ear an honest accomplishment or the smallest act of caring all of which have the potential to turn a life around it is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful they are found because it was possible to find them write this down my life is full of unlimited possibilities stop waiting for the right person to come into your life be the right person to come to someone's lifewhat good has impatience ever brought it has only served as the mother of mistakes and the father of irritation the problem isn't that i think so highly of myself it is just that you think so little of yourself live life big bold and out loud if at first you don't succeed you re doing it wrong learn from the experience try again but with a different approach when you are just existing life happens to you and you manage when you are truly living you happen to life and you lead this moment is yours and yours alone take charge seize this moment and allow it to propel you to the high levels of an empowered life allow upon this fertile moment to be planted the seeds of your happiness and success the people we consider successful in our society are all people that seize every moment and make the best of each situation where we fall are the stepping stones for our journey a good self esteem level is mostly dependant on how we value ourselves without any bias your limits are somewhere up there waiting for you to reach beyond infinity you are where you are and what you are because of yourself nothing else nature is neutral nature doesn't care if you do what other successful people do you will enjoy the same results and rewards that they do and if you don't you won't it is important that when we make a resolution or establish a goal that we take the action necessary to accomplish that goal great losses are great lessons once we open our eyes to the infinite magic that the universe has in abundance we are sure to be enthralled by what we see and this miraculous creation gets us closer to our dreams and to the world as a whole be a worthy worker and work will come we have come here together so that you might know through virtue of your own pain your own hopelessness your own fear your own darkness and the lie of powerlessness the very actual power of your own will of the will of your soul people have boldness to criticize but not to sensitize prepare yourself for success you have to see it coming to get there it will be better to spent our energy on reality the tangible facts not thoughts of the past if you can't be brave be determined and you ll end up in the same place if you don't sacrifice for what you want what you want becomes the sacrificethings do not happen to you they happen through you you are the co creator of everything in your reality while spirituality provides an efficient and endless fuel for your mind and body you must burn that fuel with human action towards your goals dreams and desires success necessitates sacrifice you don't have to be good at something to be liked every sunrise is priceless and you can experience the richness that life holds only when you live life to the full instead of just being an onlooker the more you can have control over your ego rather than let it run amuck the more successful you ll be in all areas of life how would your life be different if you began each day by thanking someone who has helped you let today be the day you make it a point to show your gratitude to others send a letter or card make a call send a text or email tell them in person do whatever you have to do to let them know you appreciate them life's a marathon not a sprint every challenge you encounter in life is a fork in the road you have the choice to choose which way to go backward forward breakdown or breakthrough the most dangerous irony is people are angry with others because of their own incompetence there has never been a meaningful life built on easy street if you always do what you ve always done you ll always get what you always got prepared for the worst but still praying for the best when the going gets tough the tough get goingeverything is easier said than done wanting something is easy saying something is easy the challenge and the reward are in the doing the job of feets is walking but their hobby is dancing take care of your costume and your confidence will take care of itself once you feel nice about yourself you have planted the first seed to develop self confidence i prefer to be on the side of losers the misunderstood or lonely people rather than writing about the strong and powerful but if we are talking in terms of making progress in life we must understand that good enough is very different from best time waits for no one the purpose of empowerment is to urge you towards freedom to help each of you to break free of all limitations it is that freedom that will give you eternal happiness and finally connect you with the unconditional realization of truth something hit me very hard once thinking about what one little man could do think of the queen mary the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder and there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trimtab it's a miniature rudder just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around takes almost no effort at all so i said that the little individual can be a trimtab society thinks it's going right by you that it's left you altogether but if you re doing dynamic things mentally the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go so i said call me trimtab the mind can't delete what the heart won't let go of you can only work on yourself start there i can't help you i can only guide you and you are the one who can help yourself you can't keep dancing with the devil and ask why you re still in hell whatever your calling it's already rooted within you and those roots can be trampled or tugged at but never removed they grow stronger only when tended nurtured and most important shared with others health is hearty health is harmony health is happiness you are a beautiful soul wrapped up in a human body it's your job to unwrap and find your soul again the people who really make you angry control you the realisation that limitations are imaginary will make you strong and overpowering we are exactly what our history made us to be how would your life be different if you decided to give freely love fully and play feverously let today be the day you free yourself from the conditioned rules that limit your happiness and dilute the beautiful life experience have fun give love play i have realized that whatever good comes to me comes from god whatever bad comes to me god has allowed it and i choose to be thankful for both let today be the day that you become committed in being in doing in getting achieving in experiencing let today be the day that you are committed to being the change you wish to see and living the life you wish to live self confidence is contagious luck is a word the bitter teach to the ignorant courage is not only about finding bravery for ourselves it is also about helping others find theirs pivoting does not mean changing your goal but rather changing your strategy to realize that goal notice the difference between being in control and needing control don't use yesterday's state of mind to make today's decision if you have to ask if you ve done enough you haven't each day brings with it the opportunity to do more than you did yesterday with one kind gesture you can change a life one person at a time you can change the world one day at a time we can change everything whenever we take a stand we invite others who are siting on the sidelines to join us the future is greatly different than your life now the actions that you take must also be greatly different you cannot do the same thing and get something different each day gives the opportunity for you to be treated right to feel worthy and to be successful it's a choice you have to make a faith you have to embrace and a standard you have to set intent without dedicated action is simply not enough action without a clear intent is a waste it is when these two powerful forces are aligned that the energy of the universe conspires in your favor you are the point of origin for everything in your world you set the standard for yourself the time has come to harness the blessed power within us and to use it to transcend from our current existence into a more empowered reality when someone who is suffering looks to you for compassion it's indeed a blessing you are chosen to be their light in a moment of sorrow i would rather live short and right then long and wrong the face is the mirror of the mind and eyes without speaking confess the secrets of the heart we need more than just the law of attraction we need to connect with its more successful twin the law of generosity and further entwine ourselves with their parent the law of love fear has the role we give it we are able to empower or poison ourselves to whatever degree we want this is the beauty of our design you ve been given the innate power to shape your life you would not be here today if yesterday was your defining moment live this day and move towards your dreams there are two things essential if you want to enhance your jedi self confidence 1 belief that it is possible 2 that self help is the best helpevery great leader can take you back to a defining moment when they decided to leadnever engage in gossip it kills your soul and wounds another's heartyet how hard most people work for mere dust and ashes and care taking no thought of growing in knowledge and grace never having time to get in sight of their own ignorance sometimes we have to soak ourselves in the tears and fears of the past to water our future gardens you be as angry as you need to be she said don't let anyone tell you otherwise not your grandma not your dad no one and if you need to break things then by god you break them good and hard he couldn't look at her he just couldn't and if one day she said really crying now you look back and you feel bad for being so angry if you feel bad for being so angry at me that you couldn't even speak to me then you have to know conor you have to know that it was okay it was okay that i knew i know okay i know everything you need to tell me without you having to say it out loud all right he still couldn't look at her he couldn't raise his head it felt so heavy he was bent in two like he was being torn right down through his middle but he nodded a real decision is measured by the fact that you ve taken a new action if there's no action you haven't truly decided the difference between being mediocre and achieving excellence is you a failure is always in the passenger seat in his or her life pursue your goal opinions be damned until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initative or creation there is one elementary truth that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would otherwise never have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones's favor all manner of incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have believed would have come his way whatever you think you can do or believe you can do begin it action has magic grace and power in it i must admit that i have learned more from my negative experiences than i have ever learned from my positive one at any given point you can release your greatest self don't let anyone hold you back don't let anyone dilute you don't be peer pressured into being less than you are people willing to dilute themselves for the sake of others is one of the great tragedies of our time stop letting others define and set the pace for your life get out there and be your best do your best live your best make every day count and you ll see how exponentially more exciting thrilling successful happy and full your life will be your circumstances do not define you expect a grand finale faith up your purpose is greater than all your problems a master jedi feels emotions but they do not allow them to influence their reasoning yoda told luke that he would know the good from the bad when he was calm at peace the difference between those who adapted and those who didn't gorton said was a willingness to totally commit you will never get everything in life but you will get enough certain situations need a jedi like approach one of these is when you are in a strange environment usually where you feel unsure of yourself you would be surprised how if you walk with confidence and meaning people will see this as a mark of confidence yet you are perhaps shaking inside but outwardly you have the gait of a confident jedi knight it's not always what we don't know that gets in our way sometimes it's what we think we know that keeps us from learning if the painter wishes to see beauties that charm him it lies in his power to create them and if he wishes to see monstrosities that are frightful ridiculous or truly pitiable he is lord and god thereof love is perhaps the only emotions that is boundless uncertainty will always be part of the taking charge process remember diamonds are created under pressure so hold on it will be your time to shine soon one often has to do what they have to do in order to do what they want to do however if you only do what you want to do then you will never do what you have to do to be happy you have to risk being unhappy never stop acquiring the commonsense it is as good as the knowledge when i think how sometimes people can be brave enough to overcome any fear any hardship it gives me a feeling i can hardly describe to charge right at the things that are painful and difficult break through to the other side and take pleasure in that don't you think that's truly fantastic the greater the suffering the greater the joy in overcoming it feelings are real they often become one's reality but they are not always based on truth a belief is simply a thought that seems true to you jedi act with confidence move with confidence and breathe with confidence jedi possess a confident calmness in their looks attitude andbehaviour whatever you do do something positive the power behind taking responsibility for your actions lies in putting an end to negative thought patterns you no longer dwell on what went wrong or focus on whom you are going to blame you don't waste time building roadblocks to your success instead you are set free and can now focus on succeeding positive belief in yourself will give you the energy needed to conquer the world and this belief is the power behind all creation a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study believe with all your heart that you will do what you were made to do though money cannot acquire you happiness it does not mean that both money and happiness cannot exist together perseverance is the act of true role models and heroes if you don't make the time to work on creating the life you want you re eventually going to be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you don't want how many of us stop short of success on purpose how many of us sabotage our own happiness because failure while miserable is a fear we re familiar with success however dreams come true are a whole new kind of terrifying an entire new species of responsibilities and disillusions requiring a new way to think act and become why do we really quit because it's hopeless or because it's possible winning is great but if it's not enough then then you ll never have enough whatever belief we have actually stems from the thankfulness that we feel and this feeling further attracts more happy feelings towards us once you figure out what you want in life expect nothing less when something poses as obstacle to you surmount it and use it as a miracle to move on to greater height once you understand how powerful you are within you exponentially increase the power and potentiality of everything outside of you music shouldn't be just a tune it should be a touch your self confidence is simply the part of your brain that tells you whether or not you should try something different or new or believe in yourself and just as a jedi truly believes that it is within their power to control their thoughts and stay in the light so can you when in doubt throw doubt out and have a little faith we can't continuously be a society of well wishers we must take action to bring those wishes to fruition do the best you can with what you can while you can and success in inevitable one should measure their life by the faith they embrace and the relationships they cherishhow would your life be different if you could control the outcome of your day your week your year let today be the day you embrace the truth that you do have such control to label every event in your life and create an agreement with reality that empowers you and propels you to greatness you ve got one life one shot and all the power to make it happen get ready to dream big and live big it's all up to you and it starts now success is something you experience when you act accordingly success is not something you have it's something you do you can perhaps in a number of circumstances tell yourself that you can't have more than you have until you do better than you re doing but by all means steer clear of its reverse the creed of defeat in saying that you can't do better than you re doing until you can have more than you have like love like talent like any other virtue like anything else in this life happiness needs to be nurtured this is the truth of the whole matter hold company with yourself so sacredthat even when you are alone you are whole the more clouds you have in your sky the more colorful sunset it will be we do not observe reality we observe our reactions to it in other words reality is in essence neutral you give it meaning in what worldto live what loveto give is it worthy or will it breakmy heart everyoneseems to besecretly eviland to tryto disguisethe truthwith lies it's disappointingbut stilli seesomething differentin you i find hopeand i fallin lovechanges are inevitable and not always controllable what can be controlled is how you manage react to and work through the change process when a human lighthouse sees you in the midst of your storm it points you toward safety and protection in doing so it also sends you and uncompromising message of belief yes the situation is difficult but you are not alone i m standing right here with you and i know the way home the world is my church my actions are my prayer my behavior is my creed a true dreamer is one who knows how to navigate in the darki have learned that the harder you fall the higher you bounce a barrier is a limitation only when you perceive it as one when someone we know is afraid of judgment we can provide a safe haven for their hopes by telling them first and foremost that we are proud of their efforts you have had a dream for so many years let today be the day you make a plan for it just think about how much more likely you are to hit your target when you finally aim at it today you have the opportunity to transcend from a disempowered mindset of existence to an empowered reality of purpose driven living today is a new day that has been handed to you for shaping you have the tools now get out there and create a masterpiece have faith in the universe and its capability to lead you to the path of abundance the madder it makes you the harder you need to laugh at it coming to the end of myself and all self effort seems to be the very point that god steps in and shows himself to be more than enough dear fellow human being you are born wild you do not deserve to be tamed tell yourself you do not deserve this all those toxic words you have to listen from people all those fears they try to pin on your mind all those giggles they aim at your dreams all those judgmental stares inspecting your individuality all those fingers pointing towards your crude character all those shackles that tie your feet to social expectations all those cages that do not let your imagination fly free listen deeply you do not deserve any of it my dear fellow human you do not deserve this hostility you are born wild you do not deserve to be tamed a story meant to motivate all and sundry irrespective of their circumstanceschoice forms the divider which is responsible for the formation of all futures that can be possible i want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming always have a plan crecovery is full of ups and downs there is no such thing as a linear life but you can always turn your setbacks into setups to come back stronger an empowered life begins with serious personal questions about oneself those answers bare the seeds of success on the other hand if the future is not the one you chose then you may have to use your willpower to obtain the future of your liking most people know the physical senses but a lot of people don't know the soul's senses empathy trust intuition love and harmonyfor self educated scientists and thinkers such as charles darwin srinivasa ramanujan leonardo da vinci michael faraday myself and many others education is a relentless voyage of discovery to us education is an everlasting quest for knowledge and wisdom it is in the balancing of your spirituality with your humanity that you will find immeasurable happiness success good health and love forgive to forget do not forget to forgiveone thing i have learned from many years of watching my father is that some people the best ones are motivated more by the chance to prove themselves than by a command to serve it is the work itself that calls them onward especially if they believe they are the only ones who can do it if the world is a book are you the hero or just a walk on part when life's got you down keep your head up you can't see the ground anywaya cord that remains always in many ways don't be distracted by criticism remember the only taste of success some people have is when they take a bite out of you if you want your prayers answered get up off your knees and do something about them to become a master at any skill it takes the total effort of your heart mind and soul working together in tandem strength wasn't about being able to do everything alone strength was knowing when to ask for help and not being too proud to do it stop comparing yourself with others if they are good at something you too are good at something else self confidence is not measured by your own capabilities versus that of others but by your own needs what if i told you 10 years from now your life would be exactly the same doubt you d be happy so why are you afraid of change concentrate more on your achievements than your failures learn to take the failures as opportunities to rectify your errors if life throws you a few bad notes or vibrations don't let them interrupt or alter your song failures can be called strengtheners as they make you determined to reach your goal with the lessons they teach according to the law of attraction the physical reality that you experience at present is drawn towards the future probability you desired when it attains more power nothing that happens to you was meant to be the only thing about you that was meant to be is you blaze your own trail have nuts and be nuts pain yes of course racing without pain is not racing but the pleasure of being ahead outweighed the pain a million times over to hell with the pain what's six minutes of pain compared to the pain they re going to feel for the next six months or six decades you never forget your wins and losses in this sport you never forget i may not be where i want to be but if i stop now i ll never get where i m going we ve also evolved the ability to simply pay it forward i help you somebody else will help me i remember hearing a parable when i was younger about a father who lifts his young son onto his back to carry him across a flooding river when i am older said the boy to his father i will carry you across this river as you now do for me no you won't said the father stoically when you are older you will have your own concerns all i expect is that one day you will carry your own son across this river as i no do for you cultivating this attitude is an important part of humanism to realize that life without god can be much more than a series of strict tit for tat transactions where you pay me and i pay you back learning to pay it forward can add a tremendous sense of meaning and dignity to our lives simply put it feels good to give to others whether we get back or not self belief also called self efficacy is the kind of feeling you have when you have like a jedi mastered a particular kind of skill and with its help have been able to achieve your set goals don't get too deep it leads to over thinking and over thinking leads to problems that don't even exist in the first place going down in history is a dead end pursuitin the spiritual world many forms of the physical universe that are potentially effective can be perceived but with regard to time we can observe only one form god can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary our incredible god has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams remarkable things happen in your life when you believe war is not just the shower of bullets and bombs from both sides it is also the shower of blood and bones on both sides some years ago i was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people artists and scientists writers and discoverers of things and i felt that at any moment they would realise that i didn't qualify to be there among these people who had really done things on my second or third night there i was standing at the back of the hall while a musical entertainment happened and i started talking to a very nice polite elderly gentleman about several things including our shared first name and then he pointed to the hall of people and said words to the effect of i just look at all these people and i think what the heck am i doing here they ve made amazing things i just went where i was sent all my life i ve been fascinated by the precipice in all of us when you come to it you either choose to fall or you don't alvin aileyif you won't trust yourself nobody else will a farmer is a magician who produces money from the mud if your failure is not a lesson it's indeed a failure what if not just women but both men and women worked smart more flexible schedules what if the workplace itself was more fluid than the rigid and narrow ladder to success of the ideal worker and what if both men and women became responsible for raising children and managing the home sharing work love and play could everyone then live whole lives let them be what they want to be make yourselves what you want to be in the history of a soul's evolution there is a critical point of the human incarnation that decides for us whether we stay there go down or progress upwards there is a knot of worldly desires impeding us cut the knot by mastering desires and go forward this done progress is assured those who believe in it are the ones who find itwhat we perceive about ourselves is greatly a reflection of how we will end up living our lives yawns are not the only infectious things out there besides germs giggles can spread from person to person so can blushing but maybe the most powerful infectious thing is the act of speaking the truth each person has got a voice inside them communicate with it and take hold of it do not let it push and shove you around you are its master if the fire in your heart is strong enough it will burn away any obstacles that come your way you re only responsible for yourself jess and that's the only person you can control other people will either get it or they won't but you can't define yourself by their opinions how we relate with other people is dependent on how we rate ourselves and what we think about ourselves always make your future bigger than your past taking the decision making process away from people disempowers them it also makes them much less likely to buy into the decision however right it may be one's own conscience remains the ultimate arbiter some of the most powerful speeches i have given have been delivered in the dedicated silence of my actions but confining myself more to the particular i say that a prince may be seen happy to day and ruined to morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character this i believe arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length namely that the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes i believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful because men are seen in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him namely glory and riches to get there by various methods one with caution another with haste one by force another by skill one by patience another by its opposite and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method one can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end the other fail and similarly two men by different observances are equally successful the one being cautious the other impetuous all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times this follows from what i have said that two men working differently bring about the same effect and of two working similarly one attains his object and the other does not father has a strengthening character like the sun and mother has a soothing temper like the moon five years from today you will be the same person that you are today except for the books you read and the people you meet our own self esteem is something we can actually twist in whatever way we want i don't give up that makes me incredibly resilient or maybe stupid or just plain stubborn whichever the greatest emotion is love the greatest quality is seeking to serve others the greatest gift is your own life the greatest pleasure is chocolate the greatest thing you ll ever learn is that there's always something new to learn the greatest virtue is temperance the greatest meditation is a peaceful mind the greatest practice is to be kind education the greatest challenge is to let go the greatest wisdom is to be in the nowleave that room kid shut the screen off take your dirty shoes not the pretty ones and go out to feel the wind touch water touch earth touch wood touch skin touch everything you can touch and memorise everything because that's all you will live off in the end and that's all you will need for that reason let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state the means will always be considered honest and he will be praised by everybody because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it and in the world there are only the vulgar for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on without adversity there would be no growth and without growth there would be no lesson to be learned one of the secrets in life is to make stepping stones out of stumbling blocks there is no real world just the one you create leaders in over their heads is the mere result of getting ahead of their intended season the word seek is a verb are you treating it as such in your life if you seek change success or love do it be it how would your life be different if you had a plan of action towards your goals let today be the day you stop allowing your days to be stolen by busy nothingness and take calculated steps towards your goals a champion is someone who gets up when he can't your only limitations are the ties you allow to bind you you do not become outstanding by working on your weaknesses you become outstanding by focusing entirely on your strengths the lion never fears to walk alone never let the opinion of another affect your opinion of yourself encourage lift and strengthen one another for the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all for we are connected one and all always strive to aim for the highest peak of the goals in life you have set this way if you manage to reach even half way toward a goal landing in the middle is not such a bad place to end up someone needs to fight someone needs to sacrifice someone needs to inspire someone needs to be a hero success is a decision not a gift to embark on the journey towards your goals and dreams requires bravery to remain on that path requires courage the bridge that merges the two is commitment if you take any step no matter how small it is towards achieving your dreams then you will surely find the right path and reach the abundance that lies in store for you limitations are like mirages created by your own mind when you realise that limitation do not exist those around you will also feel it and allow you inside their space with every challenge you face

have been done the day before yesterday circumstances knowledge or birth do not determine the realisation of your desires it is only you who are blocking the achievement of your dreams and goals everyone has too much of something whether it's time talent or treasure everyone does have their own half you just have to find it ideas and philosophies have a shelf life they must be kept fresh and renewed or they will spoil if left unattended the same ideas and philosophies that once nourished you and helped you grow can poison you and make you sick become aware of new ideas that can refresh your way of life and be open to the fact that your old ideas and philosophies can work for you for some time but when the shelf life has passed those ideas and philosophies could also harm you this

what would life be if we didn't shake and wake ourselves up once and a whilethe only time a man can do the right thing is right now if you want to tell the world who you are then the world must first show what you do strange things are always abounding watch and discern there is always a lesson to be learned on the road to liberation learn to press next even if there is no such an option when you have nothing to lose remember you are standing at the winning position for the hard times have got you stronger and what you achieve now will be a remarkable trophy for your battles be disciple of

but can be what others are craving forability experience and books have solution for all the problems your youth is certainly finished and old age has definitely arrived if you feel that you are losing enthusiasm excitement and energy towards your dreams and goals my five dos for getting back into the game 1 do expect defeat it's a given when the stakes are high and the competition is working ferociously to beat you if you re surprised when it happens you re dreaming dreamers don't last long 2 do force yourself to stop looking backward and dwelling on the professional train wrecki figure sometimes bad things happen to us so we can achieve a higher purpose and attain greater happiness and fulfillment in life compromise brings harmony to both happiness to none dare to be a fool in the face of impossibilities don't violate the law but don't reject an idea because it's illegal you might be able to get the law changed to fall in love for any reason does cause fires of emotion when we are in love we ride on a positive energy as compared to not being in love when we are love we transcend conditional love to that of unconditional and we are now flowering in consciousness love is a very important element of consciousness as it becomes purer with source union even as our consciousness is expanded further consciousness is love that is light holding on to the past will hold you down in life learn from it but move on greatness comes from the inside and once you believe you have it it's yours to share with the world if thinking should precede acting then acting must succeed thinking in our worldly perceptions of jesus we tend to embrace the kindness of his love be encouraged but not the discipline of his love and sin no more but with the whole scope of his love or maturity in christ we begin relying on him for guidance where we would prefer him to walk beside us rather than behind us we learn best when we care about what we are doing when we have choices we learn best when the work has meaning to us when it matters we learn best when we are using our hands and our minds we learn best when the work we are doing is real and relevant between natural ability and education choose natural ability as it will keep you happy and will fetch you the glory sooner if you dare take the challenge you will possess the courage to conquer the strong man is not one who is good at wrestling but the strong man is one who controls himself in a fit of rage only hardship softens the hardness of the human heart it takes understanding to be outstandingone sure way to kill a dream is to suffocate it with worry the greatest happiness is a quiet kind it's the tender understanding that we re living in a very strange place full of strange creatures and there's quite a bit of wonder in that you cannot fit yourself in to greatness this can only be done by embracing and pursuing your biggest dreams and desires life is about peeking through the veil of forgetfulness what is hidden awakens the joy of revealing it well if it can be thought it can be done a problem can be overcome anytime you re afraid to try something new just remember amateurs built the ark professionals built the titanic to achieve anything you must be prepared to dabble on the boundary of disaster without inspiration the best powers of the mind remain dormant there is a fuel in us which needs to be ignited with sparks like everything in life it is not what happens to you but how you respond to it that counts don't hide what you have just because people tell you it's not normal i have known normal people and guess what they are as boring as hell it is never about who is right or wrong it is about what is best reach for the sky but keep your feet on the groundshame and blame should have no place in our body mind or spirit our perceptions are influenced by our surroundings you can start to change your luck today begin believing that you can have what you desire and superior things will arrive did you have a rough month i did but you know what there's no time to dwell on a missed opportunity or worry about what i should ve done or said beating myself up making myself miserable about my mistakes that doesn't work so will take notes from that put it behind me move on finish the year strongfear is the fatal killer of desire get a grip on yourself there's only one god here on earth and that's you if you don't like the world make one you like better shrug off the no's they are temporary this is your world in your world there is only yes the thrust of continuous action is the firewood which fuels motivation through my choices and actions i have learned the most effective way of speaking to god is without saying a word trust your passion identify your dreams and find the courage to share them with others no matter how many times they call you a fool on your quest to spirituality it is often required to suspend your rationality but true spirituality asks that you enhance your rationality not matter what your sacred or religious book is it's not how well you know the book it's how well you re in alignment with the author along our chosen paths we all meet up with demons we must meet them and battle them even when they are nothing but mist in the night faith is the poetry of our dreams action is the builder of our reality i ask myself are defeats necessary well necessary or not they happen when we first begin fighting for our dream we ve no experience and make many mistakes the secret of life though is to fall seven times and to get up eight times holding on holding out and holding fast when the going is tough constitutes a winning mindset if you are not able to see your goals they will take longer to achieve and sometimes longerdon't forget to collect the memories on your journey remember if you only focus on your destination you will miss out on the benefits of the journey cada persona tendrá su propia lista

address your unwillingness to do itif one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty what you wish to be be there's an interesting story about abraham lincoln during the american civil war he signed an order transferring certain regiments but secretary of war edwin stanton refused to execute it calling the president a fool when lincoln heard he replied if stanton said i m a fool then i must be for he's nearly always right and he says what he thinks i ll step over and see for myself he did and when stanton convinced him the order was in error lincoln quietly withdrew it part of lincoln's greatness lay in his ability to rise above pettiness ego and sensitivity to other people's opinions he wasn't easily offended he welcomed criticism and in doing so demonstrated one of the strengths of a truly great person humility so have you been criticised make it a time to learn not lose if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized we put great expectations on our tomorrows when we truly need to rely on ourselves far too many overlook personal action as a means to get things done blame is easily passed if one does not hold themselves accountable man is not merely born to

become fact because you wish it were true fiction does not become fact because it has turned into popular opinion remember this before reading the news views opinions or commentary if you are paying someone to motivate you seriously you should rather pay to a psychiatrist your greatness is measured by your horizons there is only one thing that is more natural than thinking breathing and it is in breathing that we find the door to happiness i'd like to be an example of no matter how dark and thick and hopeless it feels for years maybe things can and will change life isn't a struggled to know what's right it's a struggle to do it i ve had many dreams useless dreams while sleeping priceless are those that guide me while awake meditate on holy scriptures if you desire to grow strong in spirit the effort you put into something is never wasted even if it leads you to disappointing results your efforts make you wiser more skilled and more experienced and that's a positive outcome for any effort show yourself approved we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back tomorrow will never call to ask your opinion you don't control it stop allowing today's possibilities to be robbed by tomorrow's insecurities time is too short in this one life to be able to do everything but it definitely is long enough at least to be able to develop the will to do anything everything in meetings philosophy might work on the field practicality works you are conditioned to believe that if you let go if you surrender you will either be a victim of circumstances and not assertive in your own being or you will be viewed as being lazy lacking in willpower and un motivated yet will and power cannot exist alongside one another motivation does not come into question when you surrender fully into the present moment motivation to do to take action to make moves comes naturally from this surrender the victory over our inner self is a daily struggle be strong and do not give up when you practice leadership the evidence of quality of your leadership is known from the type of leaders that emerge out of your leadershipcomfort zone simply means the routine of one's daily life it is a psychological state in which one feels familiar safe at ease and secure you can keep pondering on which thing to do first or which path to take or by simply taking action now of most any kind you may just find yourself on the way to where you most needed to go when you start to accept responsibility for the results you get in life you also take back the power to change your future outcome let's always try to paint the truth our art must be made to mean something patience more than the ability to bear pains or endure waiting is to be calm no matter what happens constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting a man who has come to the full realization of his responsibility to men won't stick to one man it will be foolhardy if he does that perform your task and i shall know you perform your task and your genius shall befriend the more failure does not connote that you achieved nothing it denotes that you are on an adventure towards finding what will eventually advance you to the realization of your goals be creative enough to dream brave enough to try persistent enough to succeed and humble enough to thank those who helped you along the way just like waves in the ocean come and go no challenge is permanent problems will come and go too we must enjoy the challenges just like we enjoy the waves rvm the results of knowledge without application results in nothing at all do what you know better

things will happen you can't stop them from happening but you can control your reaction from making things worse react positively live happily problems are everywhere so are solutions unfortunately we see more of the problems than the solutions rvmmake your lives a masterpiece you only get one canvas the enemy of art is the absence of limitations too often people get stuck in a state of over thinking the result is that they never reach a decision compete like you cannot fail the first step is the most important it is the most crucial and the most effective as it will initiate the direction you have chosen if not now when act like a champion and then become one it is action that creates motivation share your aspirations only with those who will support you not those who will respond with doubt or lack of interest blame is the creed of the disempowered if you remain static and wait for success to come to you it will certainly not happen if you want to continue to be the best in the world then you have to train and compete like you are second best in the world i acquired courage from the masterpieces of sages i came of age by their instructions to keep going even in hard times then i learnt not to despair even when it seemed that my world is falling apart i learnt to possess fortitude if not you who it is one thing to know what should be done it is another to do it nothing could be any worse than having to turn to your friends your colleagues and your loved ones and say i gave up too soon men's best successes come after their disappointments mix with positive minded people as a means to tap into your unexploited potential success is simply never giving in to failure either in mind or body 100 of a guru's marketing plan depends on you holding the belief that you are not enough that you were created less equipped than necessary to fulfill your purpose what if you let go of that belief and connected with the truth of your innate power to change and shape your life you are enough you can change and shape your own life anyone who tells you different is simply lying your life has immeasurable potentiality for greatness act accordingly see it feel it trust it the only test is what you see when you look in a mirror it is true to say that the secret of a winning formula is the ability to accept that there is a vast area of unexploited potential beyond what you currently perceive to be your maximum if you are able to focus unswervingly on your goals then all that you desire will become yours the sprint is like life blink and you miss it just identify the very first physical action you need to take and do it you have to create your self belief by going to your core to find the probable reasons for the negativity in you and then demolish them maybe the secret to continued success is as simple as knowing that your past successes could be done so much better now over the years i ve come to realize that determination makes one to punch above one's weight the slogans hang onthere are three types of people in this world firstly there are people who make things happen then there are people who watch things happen lastly there are people who ask what happened which do you want to be if obstacles are large jump higher if you have positive energy you will always attract positive outcomes look for solutions instead of being difficult be more thoughtful instead of allowing anger to burn you out look at things from a different perspective embrace change look out for opportunities and you will feel much more in control see it first in your mind then become it every time a champion makes a decision they have a chance to learn something new regardless of the outcome invest your energy in the things you can control a mind filled with negative thoughts makes you feel miserable and inadequate and will lead to failure after failure no matter how hard you try to succeed if humans can live for 100 years why do companies die so young lucky people will focus on what's in front of them rather than scrabbling about for what they re searching for explore train your conscious mind and your subconscious mind to start working for you by getting those great powers to move in a new direction start creating your own good luck today remember if you don't do anything if you don't change the way your mind works and direct your subconscious mind to create the life you want then everything stays the same nothing changes they don't give olympic medals out for talking a good game to think is good to obsess is bad the challenge for you is to decide not what is important but what is most important and then focus your attention on that your current apathy is simply your soul telling you that it is confused although you can't go back in time and alter your natural level of potential you can determine how much of that ability you tap into exploit and develop for the future when you think a positive thought you become positive do you want to know what one of the secrets to achieving all of your goals is you ve got to be committed the real beginning of influence comes as others sense you are being influenced by them when they feel understood by you that you have listened deeply and sincerely and that you are open for many lack of achievement is more a consequence of fear of taking a chance and getting uncomfortable the way forward is to stop pestering yourself for answers and let it the creative part of your mind come up with the solution when the time is right if you decide not to take action you are going to fail and even if you do take action if you can't keep up your motivation you will simply end up back where you started these are the people who will encourage you to go after your dreams and will inspire you to succeed stick to them like a barnacle to a rock success is virulent once you get the bug then it's in you the people and successes in your life mirror your beliefs tell me your thinking and i ll tell you what your life looks like to deliver your own personal maximum you ll realise there are no shortcuts if you want to be a champion it is all about rolling your sleeves up and getting stuck in trust in your own beliefs or succumb to the influence of others we do not just go through life blindly we create our own journey your faith has sculpted you into the human being you

make you finish strong you see that starch you quited it what you need food is for body eat it in a right way and time limit it instead of cut it off cause the work of power sometimes you doing

kiss your wounds as you pick up what is left of the broken promises and wishes that remain unfulfilled so you will press those pieces like roses between the pages and every tear will turn to a sonnet

yourself what we achieve or don't achieve in our lives depends on our decisions while some decisions open doors others push us down into a pit of problems the truth is that happiness doesn't come from wealth perfect looks or even a perfect relationship happiness comes from within life is a continuous lesson we need to embrace each problem in life good or bad we need to grow as a human being and

began writing this book in 2007 and it has been a series of challenges from day one i wanted it to be a complete book filled with my own experiences with dogs for the past 30 years as well as different voices from different fields across the globe their experiences if you will understand that you are capable of doing anything in this world then you will never be disappointed with your failure your actions and discipline will define your future no matter what situation you are in in your life if you have a great vision to achieve your dreams you will achieve your dream in any circumstance if you have strong faith in your vision then get ready to fail a million times to reach your destination your story is really inspirational you just need to be successful to inspire people all over the world if it's your dream to become something very important do anything to achieve it stop chasing people if they aren't coming into your world after several invites then they

not don't let the fear of the unknown guide your heart and judgement you are capable of many things and no one can stop you from greatness but yourself people should focus on becoming more knowledgeable and disciplined rather than earning degrees you can go into any big corporation with clarity and confidence of your skills and knowledge and get job without degree express what others are afraid to express and they will see great power in you focus on using your life to the highest potential the journey of making the right decision begins with making the wrong decision you must know that you cannot take anything with you when you are dying and by the way slowly you are dying everyday those who do not know the value of freedom or who think that something is more important than their freedom they commit crimes social and spiritual entrepreneurship is the future of entrepreneurship if you think you have entrepreneurial mindset then you should quit your job and start hiring people for your startup your frequent failures are the result of your persistent bad habits and undisciplined life understanding why you got success or failure is more important than any success or failure no one will appreciate your words so make your words your world it is a great experience to be a monk to give up the fake life and embrace the real life a bad day doesn't mean a bad week or a bad month or a bad year instead of doing a hundred things do one thing a hundred times growth redefines itself without permission today is the only day seize it life is only enjoyed in the today do not let your today be stolen by the immutable past or the indefinite future don't despair nor be discouraged changing hearts and minds requires humbleness empathy and understanding it requires that we maintain our optimism about other people and their ability to evolve and change it means not giving up hope that they may one day have a change of heart it means appealing and calling to that deep human longing for dignity and equality that echoes in each of us that childlike innocence openness and inclination to embrace the unknown life is a one way path without a return ticket if you love me i am in your heart if you hate me i am in your head either way it's flattering to know that you can't spend a moment without me if insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result then sanity is to change what you are doing until you see the result that you want i can be both nice and bad you get the side you deserve never settle with average in times of difficulties do not get discouraged do not lose courage in any circumstance don't let anybody put you in a box you are much more than a millennial much more do pushups so if you fall down you

flynot to fall by now marvin interjected you must all be wondering why i invited you here well you know why you re here arthur and i assume you ve explained a little about the club to our members we re looking at alternative truths right bedivere asked the darker side to britain and all that yes yes bedivere we shall cover that we shall look at europe why we left and why ultimately the eu was disbanded we shall look at the tragic situation in the united states and we shall look at the abandonment of the commonwealth states and the blight of indonesia but as well as that we shall also be looking closer to home at our own histories and i use the plural intentionally at the rising rebels in the old celtic countries at the redefinition of new national britain's borders and at our absolute ruler himself george milton who thus far has used all his electoral power to claw hold of democratic immunity whose party has long since been a change hand change face game of musical chairs with the same policies and people from one party to the next this brings me to my former point of why i invited you here because i believe that you three are the smartest the most open the most questioning and that you will benefit most from hearing things from an alternative viewpoint not always my own and not always comfortable that the three of you may one day take what you have learned here and remember it when the world darkens and this country truly forgets that which it once was there was a deep silence even arthur who was used to marvin's tangential speeches was momentarily confounded and in the quiet that followed he observed bedivere to see what he thought of this side to their teacher his eyes then slipped to morgan and he was surprised to find that she was transfixed but i must stress to all of you it is my job at risk in doing this my life at stake so when you speak of this speak only amongst yourselves and tell no one what it is we discuss here understood there was a series of dumbstruck nods of consent bedivere cleared his throat with a small cough and here i thought this was just going to be an extra curricular history club he joked you would argue that we re not a parasitic life form arthur challenged morgan seemed wounded do you think i m parasitic arthur asked bedivere his eyebrows raised no but how about gwen he added teasing of course not i didn't say that the individual is parasitic just our current way of life consumerism is destroying the planet no it has destroyed the planet why do you think half the world has starved to death there's not enough left to support everyone says who morgan snapped says common sense he could feel the wine loosening his tongue people are lying when they say things aren't that bad what do you think all those wars were for we were all just fighting over who got to eat the last éclair marvin's stomach growled and he awkwardly cleared his throat you can not win until you re losing in your mind if your mind is strong then your life gets stronger successful life is a balance between happiness and sadnessyour child is a mirror of your behaviour and the culture of your homesleep the most relieving thing from all sufferings it is free but not everyone lucky enough to have itevery morning brings freshness and new hope be like morningthere is no new education like experience you can't be big without taking big risksa quote equals a good booklife is a school of learning the more learning you make the better living will be don't fight with darkness just come out of it time has only one actuality that it will pass either as it wishes or you wish it to life is not about a goal to be achieved but a goal to be reached always remember that your goals require dedicationdetermine what your motivation is once you discover that driving force than you ll become focused on the process yesterday exists in our memories today is our present and tomorrow has yet to appear today is the step you take towards your goals i ve now come to not only accept my bicultural identity which i d spent my entire life running from in order to fit in better just in one category but actually to be empowered by my duality the vision never leaves it just waits for you to see it again who knows where and what turn will come still getting acquainted with the roads go getters don't know the term couldn't don't take my word for it i challenge you to do your own homework the minute you conform yourself to how people want you to act and behave you unconsciously become under their control it only puts you in a dark space and whatever you do will naturally be subject to their validation just do what you feel is right we know that our best days aren't behind us we know that america is the country that freed millions of people in the last hundred years alone we are the people who changed the world we are only a simple change of mind set from being that nation again start telling yourself i don't need the government to do it for me the first step in recovery is to admit you have a problem so say it rest assured that others more timid than you will join in the fight but they wait for you ideas of every kind are constantly galloping towards us constantly passing through us constantly trying to get our attention let them know you are available i am not what happened to me i am what i choose to become one day or day one you are incontrol of your life and careerin my bones you once called me a victimbecause i did not acceptthe disrespect you gave that's the dayi should have walked awayinstead of fighting for somethingnot worth restoring if ever you believed me to be a victim you never knew me at all overcoming is in my dna surviving is in my bones each time life threw me a curveball i learned to pitch it on my own and hit home runs for survivalyou can take a little bit of the east and a little bit of the west and create a formulaic soup in life that works best for you no one else has to drink it if they don't likesometimes i can't be both the east and the west and i wish i had a compass that could decide for me less stressbleed out your art bleed it out through your heartto see you shine brighter on the tip of that hill is a cosmic dealto methere is no reason to be alive if you can't do deadlift we humans are sucker for soft power i write for children because i know that somewhere in a home i will never visit a child i will never know has some enjoyment and happiness that may not have otherwise existed that alone is my success overnight success stories are not the entire storycount your blessings not your problems life is a game if you know the rules you will always win non aver fretta la vita non scappa via it doesn't always take an army to save the world sometimes it takes just one person who won't let evil win women leading and building businesses on their own terms are helping all people create momentum and rise one of the most powerful things you can do is teach the importance of network to a young woman in your world rocking the boat might be risky but lasting sea changes cannot be made without a call to chart a new course you can be an advocate for change no matter where you are one of the simplest ways we can help another woman is just to say yes yes to an introduction yes to a thirty minute call yes to giving some advice yes to any request within the realm of possibility we can help another woman help herself we can create potential opportunities for growth we can share our wisdom and advice but there will come a time when the only thing left to do is stand up for her by giving another woman a chance to help you you are also giving her an opportunity to feel valued and whole to succeed at ityou must do more of it twinkle in your smile is the music of my lifeif you know what you need to do the next step is simply to do it stop waiting start taking action aber träume waren ein zähes unkraut und alles was sie brauchten um wieder zu wachsen war ein winziger tropfen hoffnung moving beyond of your comfort zone does not mean that you must grow outside of your familiar surroundings but rather that you must try something new in order to add different gems to your life it all begins with your own heart which should resemble conviction enthusiasm and consistent determinations why wait for happiness when happiness is nothing but a limitless chase empower your struggles it's the most vital phase essere di sinistra oggi vuol dire pensare agli altri e al futuro anzi pensare agli altri nel futuro put yourself in tough situations accept challenges familiarize yourself with the unfamiliar that's how you widen your perspective and your understanding a wise man cannot be hurt twice by a single stonefeeling like the phoenix in a one year timeline it might look like you are losing when you re the winner in a 10 years timeline if wishes were fishes we would all cast a net good leaders being scarce following yourself is allowed nie mamy nic tylko właśnie nasze życie jak jedną jedyną monetę chodzi o to żeby za nią kupić to czego chcemy be thankful for the rain during the times that you prayed for sunshine sometimes it's not really the sun that we always need like a flower we need a little rain for us to keep growing i am whatever i need to be to survive roles are as interchangeable as clothes and there are enough fools out there for me to live a long and prosperous life the role i ll play next is that of executioner an idea has more potential than any theory plan or quantity of knowledge you should never underestimate your dreams and the ideas that form around them but more importantly you shouldn't waste any time making them a reality others may not agree with your ideas they may not trust your ideas and they may even think that it is foolish to follow your dreams but they don't have to trust something they can't see each person is gifted with the dreams that match the soul attracting them and according to the nature of the spiritual path in which one is found therefore any dream you have is within your reach and may never be within the reach of the beliefs of others not even when you fulfill them when people don't trust your capacities to achieve something they will also rationalize reasons and excuses after you demonstrate your intent and potential if you are poor they may say you can't be rich and once you are rich they will try to dissuade you from what you do with insinuations insults and threats the most common question a rich person is asked is if he is paying taxes it is foolish to try to explain anything to those people i ve seen it my entire life because i have succeeded in many areas where everyone told me i would never succeed once you win they downgrade your achievements with ridiculous theories or they will simply call you lucky you can't win in an argument with a fool because fools are very creative in their own art of denying the being of others they see the world as they see themselves as just objects empty vessels reflections of the illusions on the outside world in martial arts if you beat taller and stronger opponents they don't say you are a better fighter they will select one of your movements or techniques as the cause and then dissociate you from the movement or technique and say that you win because you cheat in the fighting rules in music if you succeed against the best in the world people won't say you are better than them but dissociate you from your music and say that you got awarded because you are different in a strange way or because you competed in a special moment if you succeed as a writer people won't say you are a good writer but instead dissociate you from your books and say that you invent things and have a big imagination which is a covert way of calling you a good liar thus insulting you under the pretense of giving compliments or they will say that you stole the knowledge from others in order to morally place themselves above you and your work and they may even say that you have a special trick like taking knowledge from the air from some imaginary records in the ether or from demonic spirits people say different things when dissociating you from your potential work and achievements all of which are simply various forms of disrespecting someone they deny you of your potential to be yourself and among the various forms of disrespect making one feel guilty for being himself is probably the worse reason why you ll find the most disgusting people of them all inside religious organizations god won't like it you have a problem with your ego and the devil is tempting you are among the most common and imbecile things you will ever hear as an artist as a person who loves to read and acquire knowledge and above anything as a true spiritual being thriving in self development and a natural curiosity for life for all these reasons the requirements and the real theories for success will never be found in any popular book nobody wants to know that you only win when you stop burning yourself to make others warm and when you understand this people will dissociate you from your focus and discipline and call you selfish and they will call the person who guided you in this path of real success evil they will then do their best to destroy the reputation of both of your to deny their own fault ignorance and lies an idea has more potential than any theory plan or quantity of knowledge you should never underestimate your dreams and the ideas that form

losing a single breath requires tremendous bravery unity brings strength disaffection brings weakness being invincible is the only way to determine how strong you are it is impossible to realize your incredible potential if you constantly try to be like everyone else without trying your own brand of originality it is possible to discover your own beauty even in the littlest things which makes life more enjoyable and meaningful stop being afraid of living it's easy to die for someone death is final you do it once and it's over you know what's harder more terrifying yes but equally rewarding and fulfilling living for someone regret can be a great motivator but so can achievement motivating your team is like cooking you need to select and blend the right quality ingredients and serve them fresh as often as you can otherwise your team will get hungry and grumpy throughout our lives pain visits us in turns there isn't a human alive that hasn't been touched by pain we all carry scars and wounds but only some rise to the surface to be seen and commented on simply put the story of pain is common to us all the only thing stopping you from achieving the life that you want is you you have started on the journey and it has not been an easy ride make it count don't let everything you have gone through be for nothingfaith in god is a sure foundation of life spare your heart some space for forgiveness not for them but for yourself are you reading books and learning something new each day tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self never let it happen to you as it did to me that you wake in the morning stare at the ceiling ask yourself what have i got to get up for today and answer nothing  the very act of empowerment can be as subtle as a kind word a look which says you ve got this an example that shows what's possible it's dark out there the path is not clear but there's nothin to fear there's a spark glowin from within that ll never ever disappear no matter how long a human being's life is one day it ends useful knowledge is the only thing that remains afterwards it keeps flying in the sky until it finds a new curious person who catches it and develops it further everything you must know lies in experience we are in a period of disruptive change darwin points out that disruptive change requires an organism to evolve just to survive but also enables opportunities to become a higher life form survival isn't good enough change your dna become that higher life form stay strong stay happy stay calm keep your faith in love new days are being announced on the horizon of the all hummanity i believe in you i believe in us i believe in the power of love underestimate everyone the one to never underestimate is yourself prioritize knowledge and not traditional education cause nobody asks you your degree while you writing them autographs when i want to do a thing i always can do it let your competitors do cheap and efficient marketing while yours entertains delights inspires and wows every moment is a miracle be determined to overcome any disappointments through diligence freedom is what we re all looking for and value is the way to achieve it when no one offers nothing to you offer people as much as the whole world offers to us live simply and give more it's best to have your tools with you if you don't you re apt to find something you didn't expect and get discouraged i want to suggest that to write to your best abilities it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you then instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work i take a book with me everywhere i go and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip in the trick is to teach yourself to read in small sips as well as in long swallows waiting rooms were made for books of course but so are theater lobbies before the show long and boring checkout lines and everyones favorite the john you can even read while you re driving thanks to the audiobook revolution i will no longer hope for nothing my soul needs a new home a new place that my heart can make it one of the main causes of stress is wanting to be perfect at everything the first time you make a sale in a new business no matter the amount it's a very big deal your life is defined not only by what you think about it but also what you think of yourself be someone worth remembering there is so much inequity that all women need to be activists in their own way female empowerment doesn't need any special training it only requires we act do it with conviction and do it often the need for women to be in positions of leadership at levels equal to men has never been more urgent the lighthouse does not qualify your distress it does not ask if you are black or white wealthy or less so democrat or republican it does not concern itself with where you stand on a particular issue nor does it blame you for being in the middle of the storm rather its priority is how it might guide you toward safe harbor when we know what we are trying to achieve we are less likely to be swayed by uninformed opinions and more inclined to make principled and ethical decisions uncompromising belief is not only about pushing back against something we disapprove of it also requires us to stand for something whether that be a principle a cause or another human being but it is when the storm rages that we fully understand the courage the lighthouse represents when the sea becomes a tempestuous beast the lighthouse transforms to an urgent beacon signaling the way toward shelter courageously defying the elements the only way to make it in this world is to want it more than anyone elseeverything is learnable and what others have learned you can learn as well don't wait for the right moment just get started and learn along the way the best use of knowledge is to share it with the aspiring minds and motivate them to reach for their dreamsa little star in yougive me courageto fly highand touch the sky remember god's working on your behalf it's not in your perfect time but know it will be perfect in his time when the heart is enlightened there is endless hope try until you die having questions asking questions to yourself with strong curiosity and to find answers shall always lead you to answers this is the best way to gain knowledge and learn in life a knowledgeable man without a strong belief self confidence may or may not achieve his goal but a man with strong belief faith in self shall definitely achieve his goal the ship of relations sails smoothly only when the rowing of ship by two or all or majority sailors on board is in the same direction having same speed and same frequency otherwise there would be only wastage of time energy of all on board without any movement towards the natural goal purpose of joyous fruitful journeyspace is nothing yet everything exists in space without space there can be nothing for everything to exist needs space nothingness is the space to everything1 truth of life every person has their own set of beliefs values perceptions opinions as all have varying degree of energy consciousness so likes dislikes decisions actions and hence soul path of every person is different also the mindset of people keep on changing with changing times caused by changes in the planetary positions which changes the energy and thus mindset of a person results do not matter in fact result is a matter itself what matters is righteous responsible intentions perception decisions actions reactions habits attitude behavior skills and i am constantly continually working and improving on that only this is the secret to successful happy life nothing matters except living life your way and to live life your way inner connection is must the only secret to find meaning purpose everlasting peace love joy success growth and happiness in lifeit is not what you get but what you make out of what you get determines your destinyif you get tired learn to rest not quit perseverance is an enduring spirit of patient do not get discouraged in the faced of many disappointments but let the experience fuel your determination to persevere until you prevail you are always one decision away from a totally different life dive into the most intimate depths and go beyond time a good quote a day will sweeten our misery and make it poof away don't be afraid of being a beginner what i loveand what i have set freeand what i await the return ofis mescrew it i ll be in my mansion soon the path to failure is one without any action if you do not act you have already failed in achieving your goal but there is time and there are loads of activities you can do to change course to move away from failure and toward success that's what accountability really is fulfilling a promise to ourselves the most difficult examinations are the ones that require us to take a hard look at ourselves and confront the things we don't like stopping in and of itself is not enough and if that is all you focus on then you run the risk of becoming overly self critical and inadequate what do you want to start doing each breath you take holds the potential for a thousand miracles no pain no creation no pressure no diamond darkness is light for in darkness your character is revealed give what you believe in and not what you have inside every success there are remnants of failure and in every failure there are pockets of success not every piece should be a masterpiecesexism underlines your irrational demands you say you re onlytrying to protect us but wish we d instead be slavesto your command don't limit me because of my disabilities let my abilities exceed your expectationswe are responsible for what happens to us not what happens to othersstart today so that everything works out tomorrowdon't be pushed by your problems swim in them you can't be a bird then cry about not being able to fly people will act like they understand you until they know you don't understand yourself whoever tames darkness tames time everybody is dead except the unselfish love to live and live to love only the coward says time and tide wait for none the valiant lives and works to build new time and to cause new tide i see you and i am listening you matterthe key to survival is to go easy on yourself winning has a price leadership has a price i pushed people when they didn't wanna be pushed i challenged people when they didn't wanna be challenged but i never asked them to do something i wasn't willing to do myself the top is ever lonely when you value the relationships that you ve built on the climb you have to see with clarity what you want and you have to have confidence in your ability to get it rather than asking yourself what it is you want to achieve ask yourself what it is you can endure to achieve it no one ever won the race with the burden of fear ego with them life's a lot like poker you bet on some hands you fold some you win some hands you lose some but unlike poker life is not a zero sum game there's enough chips in the pot for everyone the road to success begins with your dreams your struggles will shape you to create an unmatched identity of your own just because i m doing what i love doesn't mean it's always going to be fun try putting aside the thought of failure if you can do that all the things you have learned since then along with this piece will become your strength if you re upset that means you re willing to fight you re a mere human that started learning how to draw 6 months ago just who do you think you are your fight has only begun but kids who can't work hard are those that don't have any passion it's only natural for people to invest their lives on things they are most passionate about people who like to fix other people become catastrophizers fixing becomes an unconscious way of preventing a what ifpause itivity the power of the pauseit's not your present circumstances that count it's the circumstances you make up your mind to achieve that are important laughter is a salve it's the best medicine around poet pablo neruda called it the language of the soul the superpower of people with dominant fixer imposters is that they are tirelessly solution oriented and helpful particularly when the going gets rough people with dominant fixer imposters can also be master worriers they see adversity and disaster around every corner even in benign situationsadvertising and self improvement dogma would have us all believe that if we work hard enough and tirelessly on mind body soul we can not only achieve perfection but become our best selves s o u l is a powerful exercise that leads to a truly transformative way of looking at the world instead of seeing problems to fix we see solutions to manifest instead of focusing on the thingwhen i change my thoughts my problems fix themselvesif you have a dominant overthinker imposter in your driver's seat you rarely get out of your comfort zone where meaningful personal growth happens because you re too busy manufacturing questions in your head but by keeping your discomfort zone at bay you also keep at bay experiences that can enhance your creative emotional or professional mojo then you wonder why life feels so empty and you overthink that the superpower of the overthinker imposter is being able to see multiple sides of an issue and different points of view that is a powerful gift when you re faced with truly complex issues that need to be carefully considered from all angles people with a dominant overthinker imposter are often ethical reliable idealistic honest and detail oriented being in nature is imperative when life gets stormy we can live in the eye of that storm rather than get tossed about in its headwindsthe overthinker imposter is multifaceted people with this imposter in the driver's seat usually have sharp intellects and the ability to see the world from many different perspectives but they can easily tumble down the rabbit hole of worry constant second guessing and chronic indecision when we criticize or judge a friend or colleague the negativity doesn't hit them it hits you double fold you become toxic and defines who you are the judge is the ultimate icon of wisdom and authority in society they are the supreme leaders and arbiters of honesty due process and morality that's a big load to carry no wonder the symbol of lady justice comes with so many accessories the rational and dispassionate virtue of an impartial judge imposter can become irrational and cold which is the shadow side of the judge archetype you might even have a tendency to be a bit holier than thou even though under all that hubris there's usually an insecure inner child whose judgmental nature is hiding a lot of self doubtwithout the virtues of justice our modern society would look like a cross between lord of the flies and tiger king and that's why on the positive side people with dominant judge imposters are often levelheaded even tempered individuals with an uncanny ability to stay centered in relationships they re the good listeners with a shoulder you can lean on they have a sense of right and wrong and a tendency to ignore personal biases in the interest of upholding high standards if your judge imposter obscures your ability to see beyond surface glam you never experience people for who they really are i ve also traveled enough to know two things about beauty 1 it is truly in the eye of the beholder along with the judgments in the beholder's mind and 2 it is informed by the culture you grew up in what's judged as beautiful in one culture might be bland or uninteresting in anotherwhen the judge imposter is our superpower we re able to see the world with clarity and impartiality but when this imposter works against us it feeds our judgmental nature and we become our own worst critic integrating the judge imposter is a noble act that comes through self awareness and the ongoing practice of truth telling our imposters might manifest themselves in our personalities in different ways but they all come from the same place they re all rooted in our childhoods no one gets out of childhood unscathed even those of you who may have had a seemingly perfect childhoodopen up to your own sadness it's only in allowing yourself to really acknowledge and feel emotions that you re able to let them go this might sound simple and it is but that doesn't mean it's easy giving yourself permission to really grieve is difficult in our fast paced world where you re supposed to move onbeing present in nature is a way of returning to wonder and returning to wonder is a salve for the soul it's as simple and as profound as that simply being present in nature is a form of meditation in action experiencing beauty in the everyday world distances you from your impetuous imposters and you begin to see yourself with necessary distance starting your morning in a contemplative practice in silence and in relationship with yourself sets a positive foundation for the rest of the day play better games win better prizes i want my words to heal someone i want my poems to make someone hopeful i want my stories to inspire someone to never stop chasing dreams i do not fight to win i never did and never will i have always fought to kill even though going out for a jog can make you feel alive and whole and powerful it also leave you vulnerable and alone but we keep running anyway because we have no other choice we run in spite of this we run knowing the dangers knowing who we are and why we could be targeted but that won't stop usmany of us grow up feeling as if we are not truly seen for who we are we grow up feeling invisible the act of eye gazing galvanizes the simple but extraordinary power of being seen in a transcendent but deeply personal way go solo be it a trip be it a search with or for yourself we manifest what we believe even if those beliefs trip us up and create roadblocks to personal growth as the old adage by henry ford goes whether you believe you can do a thing or not you are right the goal is not to be rightonce we go through the's o u l practice we start to understand the narratives and false beliefs we have in our heads from our childhoods that no longer serve us we re then able to see the world through a new framework we move from victim to manifester we put a leash on our dominant imposter and let it serve us instead of being subservient to it it was only through countless experiences traveling the world and later through my studies in spiritual psychology that i was able to see in myself the very archetypes that i now see so clearly in others i was able to trace the roots of my fears as they expressed themselves in my own victim imposter and release them paradoxically deep down people with dominant egotist imposters often have compromised self esteem even though they seem to brim with self centeredness and what masquerades as self love without an ego we have fuzzy boundaries and lose ourselves in other people we succumb to guilt and we say yes when we should or want to say no a healthy ego helps us maintain boundaries people with dominant egotist imposters who are self actualized are often strong and self possessed leaders direct in their interaction with others and even protective of others many of them are true trailblazers when they empower people instead of intimidating them they are remarkable change agents be a wanderer who always seeks peaceful rather than being loud in another land a wise man won't cross people's border for self interest it is only through extraordinary obstacles and heart crunching ridicule that we can achieve extraordinary greatness work is the only antidote to weakness your decisions shape your destiny little everyday decisions either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by defaultyou ll either succumb or overcome the choice is yours an original quote from several of my writings don't just think and plan for your future that is not promised but for your eternity that is original quote from my book i love the art of reading when we are drowned by other people's stories and attempt to swim deep into all the chapters i was not born with a silver spoon but an old rusty steel spoon bent all out of shape over the year's i made that old spoon straight again i polished that spoon so hard now my spoon shines just as if it were made of newly minted silver if you born poor its not your mistake but if you die poor its your mistake bill gatesthe man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right dont't live in vain follow the godly vision god will help you ne ne odustajem i pobijedit ću until you exit from the earth there is hope by awakening and embodying one's childhood self something starts to shift in his adult self he understood that being of service to others takes you out of the smallness of your own issues and into the bigger realm of the heart here's a little secret ironically people with dominant seductor imposters might seem to crave intimacy they certainly draw people into their orbit with the promise of it but what actually animates them behind the scenes is fear of it the seductor imposter definitely has its superpowers of course charm charisma zeal and spontaneity when they ve done their emotional housekeeping people with dominant seductor imposters can be brilliant partners pleasure seeking and compassionate sensualists who are good at forging deep connectionswhen you live a false life regardless of how glamorous it might seem you won't find happiness or personal fulfillment the joker is a powerful archetype they are the jester the dunce the trickster and the shape shifter if you have a dominant joker imposter you might desperately want to belong but end up sabotaging the very intimacy you crave nothing is easy different things hit by different energy embrace whatever life brings for you and make peace with it we want intimacy with others in fact we might crave it but since we ve never fully experienced bonds of trust we don't allow intimacy into our lives so we keep it at bay when you believe in yourself and your abilities pinpoint what you want and strive for it you will achieve greatnessmy mom was gone the same day i have arrivedarrived in the world and lived with one parentone parent was my father who tried his best to beto be a father and a mother at the same timetime or times to remember my mom as a beautiful parentparents existsome things are not given they are taken some opportunities are not discovered they are created don't sublimate your own freedom and desires in order to satisfy the invisible judgments of others against hypothetical wrongdoings soulblazing is a practice for blazing through your emotional baggage so that you can live a more purposeful life that's aligned with your authentic self the radiant clarity that comes with daily sunrise and sunset meditations changes your energy field and vibration i call it a soul practice while each imposter negative voices in your head has negative aspects that impede you from living from your authentic soul each also has its positive qualities i call them superpowers we all internalize wounds and develop strategies to protect ourselves these strategies feed our imposters understanding your subconscious and your conscious mind is the key to cultivating self awareness basically the conscious mind is like the hardware of your computer the subconscious mind is its operating system it's composed of code or all those underlying patterns and connections that were laid down during your childhood you can't see that code but it runs the show it's the engine that determines how you react to the world at large versus how you respond to it the difference between being reactive and being responsive is the difference between night and day being reactive is like experiencing the world on choppy seas always at the whim of the weather when you understand the value of discipline complaints will dissolve from your tonguesometimes what holding us back is our thought or belief identify it and question yourself is it important enough to give it our time and energy if not entangle your mind from it and way back to yourself being responsive is like being emotionally anchored in the calm depth of the sea where the waters are clear and still no matter what's happening on the surface every day we have a choice about whether we react or respond to life the first step in that direction is becoming self aware and aligning our conscious and subconscious minds where our imposters live in short it's about becoming aware of our imposters negative thoughts in our heads we all need to do some amount of emotional and spiritual housekeeping when we commit to that process we evolve we grow and we get more in touch with our authentic souls once you start that important spiritual housekeeping work your imposters will surely protest your victim imposter might whine i don't wanna do the hard work don't make me your egotist imposter might lament i already know that i can do the hard work ergo i don't need to do it i don't have to prove anything to anyone but once we have a practice for taming our imposters we re able to get in touch with a much bigger star in the constellation of our lives the authentic soul your authentic self is informed by the experiences and hard won wisdom you ve accrued throughout your life it's also about expression who you are when you are free and uncensored your authentic self emerges when you re unburdened by the rash judgments negative self talk fears and reactivity of your imposters the best way to work through the noise and fiction of our imposters is to stop for a moment and get quiet inside observe them understand the fears and anxieties behind their chatter and liberate ourselves from them don't accept failure as an option we can travel all over the world in a soul quest to find ourselvesi believe that each one of us comes into the world with a soul which is the unique life energy that infuses and informs our being that energy our soul transcends religion what's really going on deep down is a desperate desire for love and approval but when it's not fulfilled that desire can hurt so we have a knee jerk tendency to blame others or feel slighted over the smallest act we human beings have always known that our eyes reveal our true nature it's nearly impossible to hide emotions in them look me in the eye and tell me the truth time spend with nature is the time well lived it is perfectly fine if i prioritize my career aspirations over having a child not every woman wants to be a mother and that is okay my family may have expectations of me but in the end i have to be the one at peace with my choices my kindness is not naivety it is a strength not to be messed with my voice is my own when i am quiet it is because i want to be when i am loud it is not out of rebellion my voice is not a reaction to you it's an expression of me i am a woman regardless if i am the woman you think i should be i am learning to say no to my family i am learning to say no to my friends i am learning to say no to my work setting boundaries is a good thing in the gorgeous flower meadows violent showers may constantly overflow but they still rise and gaze up at the sky there is always more good in the world than bad a small stain is easier to notice on a white shirt a life full of success will make you numb to taste defeat is to gain dignity and appreciation for the fortunate lives we lead so don't become disheartened when at loss relish in it learn and grow stronger from it and look back and remember it as just a stepping stone to greatness keep believing keep believing i hope we ve earned every ounce of joy every piece of bliss and every sip of tenderness you re afraid that you suck and at least if you never try no one especially you will be able to confirm that spoiler alert this kind of thought doesn't come from an underachiever who's not good at anything this kind of thought comes from a perfectionist and truthfully it's lame there's so much incredible potential in you but you re going to squander it because trying may or may not confirm that you re not as good as you thought you were stop being so hard on yourself anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty you ll be successful as the mother fu kers you talk to no reasondo more expect less and this is the only key to your happiness success comes only after criticism words have power put them to use in improving life you know you are alive because you feel and then you know you are strong because you heal when you hurt the key is finding a way to do it for me it is writing from the moment you wake devote yourself to the perfection of whatever you pursue with the utmost discipline no one can take away my heritage or history at the same time it is up to me to discover and embrace that knowledge i work hard and deserve to be valued and treated with respectat work unleash all that is there in you and live to your full potential success is iterative for me ideas into action constant refinements until i achieve the outcome take nothing as gospel except growth progress is not always rapid in fact sometimes it

rather than fight change a more sensible approach is to learn to live with it or to make a living from it i have my reasons if there's a 1 percent chance that something will happen then have hope expect as much as you can and it will happen pay no attention to the jibes of those who can do nothing for you your destiny a fallacy when put in others hands discovering this voice in you guiding you through and through nothing can get in the way of what you was destined to do pain comes to everyone no matter how old you are or where you live something will surely break your heart but you will return stronger he believed in perfect they will have flaws but they can be perfect for you they may not be perfect to others but to you they are perfect if something is meant for you the universe will bring it to you the world isn't fair to people people get hurt a lot and it can be unbearable sometimes as long as your heart still beats there's nothing to worry about the universe plays its part in everyone's life it can give you a lot of pain and a little bit of joy the pain you feel reminds you that you re still alive love will come at its own time you don't have to worry it will find you you don't need to find love you are worth all this pain people that love you never leave if they do they will come back let others play with your feeling but make sure that you don't play with others feelings don't be like them you re special charlie the only romance worth fighting for is the one with yourself broken dreams transform a girl into a woman and a boy into a man a bird that takes count on a third flight is a wastedseconds pig a bird that takes count on a third flight is a wasted seconds pig neither time nor space no force exists that can separate what is destined to come your way this feeling i get of worthlessness complete inadequacy i am my own worst enemy and noone has ever made me feel less than i am and noone can ever make me feel more whole than i can your actions and speech are a reflection of your character not someone else's so don't change how you act or speak for anyone why does it seem that we laze in the face of due diligence the cost of one's ease is another's suffering the value of gain we make in light of the converse is way too easily forgotten struggle for it makes you better struggle for it brings ease upon those whose fight is worse struggle and appreciation for the rewards you reap will bring ease in and of itself sometimes the only thing standing between you and your desires your goals is you we can be our own greatest inhibitors but in understanding that our situations are consequential and not merely circumstantial you can start to take the first steps in taking control and bringing outcomes that sit well with your heart everything else will fall into place in their due time and some very beautiful enlightening revelations can come to light aging with all my self to my younger self i m not twenty something anymore and in just a month's time i shall walk into another decade of a whole new experience i don't have youth on my side but i have a heart of life enlightened with the very spirit of life itself something that draws youth on its lap wisdom has been churned out from the mistakes and failures and lessons have been disguised as soul fillers and gratitude dances on my lips waving my heart with a bunch of memories perhaps the memories have been earned earned at the cost of those lost turns cold betrayals numb tears forced smiles and a voyage walking through a rainbow of mad jest of life with that being said i wouldn't go back and change even a bit through all of that heartache i have unearthed a heart that is resilient and pliant i have met a soul that is strong and loving and deeper than any thousand paged novel i could get lost in i have come across beautiful souls in beautiful lands i have soaked in different cultures and walked my way through observing hearts listening to stories that run beyond time and tide i have grown with each one of those smiles and tears the sands of places that mark my soles make my soul whole in a strange but palpable tune i have got lost in pathways and met a gypsy soul wandering in the space of infinite time weaving moments through life to take back a bunch of images and experiences from a journey called life my story has been filled with pages of ups and downs and my cup of life has had several toxic turns but in all of that i have grown along with one or two grey hair my pages have often tasted life in the most happy hue from voyages and dreams that kept overlapping and smiling across the tips of time and all of this has helped me to nurture and nourish an invincible desire to live a life with a passion no longer on hold but a heart that is free forever to fly in the tunes of its own whisper so as i open another day walking closer to close the page of this twenty something i wear a smile that the youth of wisdom paints on my heart and age with all the grace that only age can bring while loving forgiving and embracing my younger self in every air of time love a soul aging gracefully with the smile of life failure is not when you don't get success failure is when you stop trying constantly to get success i will never be that man who spends weeks and months crying over an old house i am the man who builds a new house a better a stronger a more beatifull house but in this i can only play the modest role which providence has assigned to me i can only be a small modest architect for this house the master builder is and must always remain the german volk i will never be that man who spends weeks and months crying over an old house i am the man who builds a new house a better a stronger a more beatifull house but in this i can only play the modest role which providence has assigned to me i can only be a small modest architect for this house the master builder is and must always remain the german volk different is super don't let anyone hold your dictionary define yourself everything you ve thought and still thinking of is an idea every step you ve taken towards those thoughts is work and every proceedings and inputs you ve gotten from those steps is result think right take right step so you get positive proceedings you ll never have what you want if you don't want what you haveif you need more start with lessit happens with the grace of almighty but you have to try with all your might we choose and wear our clothes every morning attitude is the same positivity is an attitude we can choose to wear it every morningsometimes it's ok not to depend on others instead do it yourself you know it ll be done right f you are going through tough times keep going perhaps you are being prepared to serve some greater purpose that will require you to be well equipped with the wisdom you have acquired through your challenges don't give up the moon is still there even on the days when you and i cannot see it and just like that the answer to your prayer is there although at times it cannot be seen if you believe you are bless if you obey the purpose of our lives is to be happy dalai lamamistake is something that happens to everyone in life some mistakes are never corrected because we learn to hide them behind our belief that it's the most appropriate way of approaching things you will never achieve your goals unless you leave your comfort zone excuses and fear are the catalysts of failure we are all broken and so when we look at other broken individuals in judgment we have god's gracious reminder to look at our own broken selves everything in your current reality began with your mentality by controlling your mind you can control your destiny treat everyone in the same way you want to be treated work so smartthat whatever you dream today is a fact tomorrow don't back your excuses back your dreams every low moment is meant for your higher evolution no way is too long for the one who doesn't stop celebrate the woman in you whom you have known the best and the longest when you love the woman in you you will love the world that shaped you we stand at armageddon and we battle for the lord being you is an absolute power that only you possess have faith in yourself and give your best shot to life everyday all that has happened let it flow in all that flows in let it shape you all that leaves let it go even if that crumbles you let it all go let it evaporate in the flames of time don't regret any part of your life any decision that you had once taken because that's exactly what it needed to be like at that very moment to make you come this far in this exact space that you occupy now sometimes you would be happy with that present space and sometimes you won't but when you find yourself distraught and broken in that state remind yourself that your journey is not over yet sometimes when you look back and see that in some parts of your life life didn't treat you great know that it isn't life it is those few people and those chosen situations that life had planned in chiselling you into your soul's very armour sometimes things that happen would never make sense but that's when you know that they are not meant to make sense and you accept them gracefully as a part of god's plans that is when you learn to accept in its absolute fullness at times life may look stagnant as if nothing makes sense and looking back you might like to put up questions before life but then you have to keep going one step at a time seeping in every breath of air in a single moment trying to nourish every bit of your soul and that is all around pain is immensely powerful and it can either ruin you entirely or form you into something beyond your imagination but that only happens when you surrender to the summit of the pain and let it flow in each atom of your soul let your suffering absorb you into its shell feel it embrace it and above all cherish it not everyone is given the power to assemble a force so pure and so vulnerably strong and then each time something comes with a face of anger envy fear or grief or anything that is disruptive you walk upon it gently with grace a smile of calmness the one that only the ocean finds to reduce the waves of a turbulent gust that is the cost you have paid rather that is the reward you have earned your perspective is your reality there is something about sibling love that is greatly overlooked due to the talk of sibling rivalry a phenomenon characterized by competition jealousy and fighting between brothers between sisters and even between a brother and a sister an older sibling's love for the younger sibling starts when the younger brother or sister is in the crib that love evolves into a rivalry that can be silent or overt as the siblings grow older but do not be mistaken by all the appearances the older sibling subconsciously retains his or her protective instinct whenever the younger sibling pursues a dangerous path in life just like in the old days when the younger sibling was a helpless baby and the older sibling assumed the role of a protector even without being asked to it is that protective instinct of the older sibling that eventually overcomes his misgivings about the ways of his younger sibling there is no good comfort like good cheer the mind of a man is his masterpiece the world seems to have counted you out time and time again but the continued reinvention the mastering of self has unleashed the supernatural an individual that has found themselves messages cannot be received if the mind is not open remember we are never given anything that we can't handle when the world crumbles around you sometimes you gotta look at the wreckage and then build a new one out of all the pieces that are still here remember that you are still here the human heart it beats approximately 4 000 times per hour and each pulsin and each throbbin and each palpitation is a trophy engraved with the words you are still alive you matter so much you re made of it poet in peace if you capture a writer the writer in them will be dead but if you let the writer free it can even conquer the rainbow for you without contentment there is no cheerfulness if you re in the habit of listening only to the facts and not the person who expresses them change your focus and really listen if you don't already have a mentor go out and find one if you can't get someone to help you in person begin the process by reading books that's where i got started the main thing is to get the process under way as you interact with people you certainly want to pay attention to the factual content of the conversation but don't ignore the emotional content sometimes you can learn more about what's really going on by reading between the lines if your child shows an aptitude or a passion for something encourage her toward it and do whatever it takes to allow her to continue pursuing it give her all the resources she needs but let her decide how to use them make the solution as your buddy like oneproblem does not end others are readyif we have the power to stand with our words of empowerment the naysayers will lose their balance flee without warning there are many books but one holy bible if you re feeling low take it as a cloudy day there shall be rain and a new level of clarity shall emerge don't think

this book over nine to twelve months ago and it was during a time of infection and recovery i was also working as a financial advisor my book is an inspiration in itself in this scenario what you don't know can hurt you i hope others will learn from my mistakes but there are silver linings for the future the economy will transform and look different from before knowledge will give you power but character respect action lies in adventure the peace of poetry is as good as the peace of prayer the future's blurry when the past is a trap work hard until you feel bitcoin is cheap when i was born my parents were not aware that they were necessarily determining my behavior they followed everyone around them if i had been a girl they would have painted my room pink instead of blue their attitude towards me would have been entirely different all of this because they just wanted me to fit in they wanted me to be normal they wanted to give me a normal childhood they did not know that they were paving the way for me to lead a normal life in doing so in a way they were instructed by the society to do so when i was assigned the color blue i was assigned how i should live i was assigned a specific type of clothes toys and interests each individual has different capabilities and hence different interests imagine what would happen if someone with no hands would be asked to draw he might achieve it somehow but it would be an excruciating and tiring process this is what happens when we develop a confident expectation from either gender when you are broken cry it out stand up then look straight to sigh relax rest it out for a few days then get up smiling believing in yourself and pick up those broken pieces of you to create a brand new better confident you somya kedianegative thoughts can be a disaster for your success poetry brings calmness of mind just like a mind set on christ is peace to strive against all the odds one must find the strength within life matters most for without life there is no living destiny is the child of action no one prays more effectively than when in pain don't follow the path where your life is taking you instead make your own path it may lead you to a place you never dreamed of you shouldn't define your life by one stroke of bad luck the spirit within the soul is the lamp of the lord one day all of the confusion and

heart is your healing god's mercies are new every new morning if you can't be good at something at least be an average sometimes being an average is good enough when you re in a car you remain still

comes in a variety of ways for some looking good is a priority for some feeling good is a priority and some requires a sudden hospital visit there is no greater sacrifice like sharing poverty is man made power the questions that keep us up at night are the questions which drive us during the day to act out of desperation is to act out of instinct to let oneself get to that point however is to ignore self preservation there is as much to be learned from a man with little as there is from a man with much a mindset of abundance can only be guided and influenced never forced to feel obligated to finish all of your food is to be living with a mindset of scarcity it is the little things from our childhood that have the longest impact withstanding hardships is a sort of sport you can't control how life plays but you can control your defensive strategy music allows me to disconnect from my present reality and communicate to my future wisdom the very answers in which we seek are

situation you re in change it now cut the ropes don't text her back change your job learn a new skill sell your house and move to a new city start over get healthy start running or play tennis or anything that gets you moving cut out processed food cut out sugar read books listen to audiobooks or watch youtube videos you live in a time where there are zero excuses you can do anything you want you want a new life well you can have it but no one will hand it to you on a silver plate you will have to stand up from that couch and go get it yourself because no one else cares no one cares about how you live your life but you generational curses are actually blessings in disguise the mistakes were already made for you now all you have to do is apply the solutions feeling uncomfortable about a situation is oftentimes the indicator that growth is about to take place all our problems are nothing compared to the previous privileged of being alive i don't think hell is a place people go when they die but it's real one of the fun things about being human is that part of who you are is how you suck everyone's got this specific tailored way that they can make the rest of the world miserable i bet if men would have taken ladies first seriously the world would be a different place a man who can cook is self reliant not soft every girl should taste a glass of self reliance trust me it's addictive no one can do everything but everyone can do somethingwhen you do something simple to someone else not only this person benefits from your simple act but also there is another person who benefits also and that person is you it is an indescribable feeling try to do a high five to someone in your way and you will experience that feeling yourself the history of an individual is a mystery to others it is wonderful fascinating and motivating if revealed the moment you learn about someone's life journey and its details you wonder and your mind questions never thought such a thing would have happened or existed that is the individual history of just one person imagine how many we are in the world of course not only the 7 5 billion current living human beings but also the other many billions who had passed away everyone has or had his own life story or even a special event that is or was unique this is treasure and wealth to others there are millions of them out there for you to have all you need to do is to look for them find where they are and then wonder after doing so it becomes a platform in your own life whether you raise your expectations of things to happen or occur or you move forward with your own set of normal expectations discovering the history of an individual saves you a lot of time energy money and many more towards your own goal's in life later yours becomes the insight for others think of it like you are on an isolated island for so long and you woke up one day and saw an empty boat is leaving the island by the force of the wind it is pushed away so fast by the wind it is your only and last chance ever to leave this island you know there are no more chances because you have been so long already on the island you definitely will sprint toward it you will use your full potentials swimming to catch it even if you do not know how to swim you still will go for it if you want to leave this island you will never think of a plan b your mind may tell you you either catch the boat or die finally when you catch the boat you say to yourself how did i do this i never exhausted this amount of energy before i never imagined this power comes out of me in addition to many following wondrous questions you ask yourself after the answer to all these questions is simple you focused all of what you have on one goal only one goal only plan athe replacement of the word regretbe a herok to yourself and feel better after being rejected from a job interview simply because it is 100 better for you not to get this job for multiple reasons only you could figure them out and believe me they do exist knowing that successes will follow after this rejection sooner or later believe in god and his power and he will make you achieve things that beyond your imagination then do not forget to share them with others to spread the power the power of god in you be the first to do the impossible because then it will be possible for others in case you fail it is fine because you have earned the honor of trying plus you are aware of your next step whether you will try it again and learn from previous mistakes or you decide to choose a different path and remember that nothing is impossible with our creator god our lord jesus christ i can do all things through christ who strengthens me philippians 4 13 the world consists of five letters established in seven days and will end in less than a second high pressure salesmen focus on the short term incentives to outweigh the long term consyour personal brand when consciously built can be a force for good or a force for destruction successful people who wish to maintain their successes must make the decision to do so envisioning without action is the equivalent of praying without faith true fame is not determined by the amount of people who heard of you rather by the amount of people who support you influence without control is a weapon of mass destruction to give support should be commonplace in our society not to be asked for movies take years to bring to theater but hours to watch strikingly similar to success it is possible for a person to change this change however must occur willingly and should never be forced to focus on your legacy when you re alive is to detract from the time you could spend building it be the one who sets the trend not the one who follows it always tell everything to your atma murti you can pray cry express your frustration joy gratitude fight everything with your atma murti continuously talking to your atma linga and atma murti will give shakti and

anywhere life is flourishing you can see the non violent beings produced by the hindu ecosystem and their contribution anywhere hindus go and settle they are the richest ethnic community whether my

generation the power of being optimistic when you listen to guruvak not only you escape from all suffocation side effects after effects you are showered by all auspiciousness i have made thousands of people achieve liberation enlightenment itself just by breaking this one pattern obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern same way i have made millions walk out of their diseases including cancer just by giving bhasma sacred ash and helping them walk out of this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern i have seen how people create delusions suffocation suffering torture themselves and others with this obsessive compulsive reactionary pattern if you break from this pattern you will start living in anandamaya kosha whatever good karma you have done the good karma will also come but the bad karma you can't escape only an enlightened being who does not have karma only an incarnation can save you from your karma when a guru gives a guruvak never judge him saying maybe this is the reason that is

regardless of what other people do say or think competition only exists in your head not in the marketplace building your personal brand is one of the few ways you can ensure that you don't stay broke at the center of all achievement is personal growth it comforts me to know that anything i put my mind to and pursue i can achieve people get too big to do the little things and then wonder why they don't have the big results heavenly father i put my hope in your holy word therefore i am happy true knowledge leads kindness a devoted life of a scholar is to study all our problems can not be compared with the precious privilege of being alive the motivation for any work should be inspiration not worry inspiration is an overflowing energy that expands your capacity to do things it is completely energizing worry on the other hand is something that shrinks your capacity it limits what you are capable of really doing because it takes away your energy o my dear one who renounced ignorance and inferiority is called a hindu for every vision there is a greater provision if you think you don't have individual identity and you are just a mixture of body mind chemicals hormones thoughts and nothing more than this mixture exists separately you will see the cosmos also the same way if you understand at some point of time in your life even when all these hormones chemicals body mind ups downs all these impermanent things are not functioning i am existing i exist so there is something more than these impermanent existences in me if you get that glimpse if you cognize it and if it hits your existence then you know the cosmos also as parameshwara existence more than the impermanent permutation combinations in every level if you realize the truth about your source how you function you will realize the cosmic source how cosmos functions if you realize the truth about how you decide at various points of your life you will realize how cosmos decides at various points of existence in every level if you just understand you you will understand the cosmos and if you understand the cosmos you will understand you if you feel indigestion in your stomach or some pain or gas or stomach upset how you take either banana or laxative like haritaki or castor oil same way if something is stuck in the cosmos and it becomes too heavy cosmos takes measurements to clean itself this pandemic which happened almost last 1 year is actually cosmos just cleaning itself so understand if you understand whatever is happening in you you will understand what is happening in the cosmos and if you understand whatever is happening in the cosmos you will understand what is happening in you atma jnana is paramatma jnana just planning is nothing execution on it is everything see beyond the apparent and think in perpetuity and execute in long terms the world might not know the real you but you must know yourself see good to feel good think constructive think moral cause your thoughts can unleash to action thoughts to words to actions with motivation and confidence make a difference but then when am i not a fool as her heart took a leap her perpetual over sensitivity shrieked out loud with a twinkle in her eye the spark of naive honesty but then again i would rather be a fool than befooled with the illusionary intelligence of them around a smile caressed her as the voice of her soul clutched her with a thousand memories of days gone by the leaf of fooled wisdom give room for peace for a love that caters not one that batters every day is a brand new day to start over again and live as if nothing has happened yesterday if you avoid knowledge about yourself you will avoid knowledge about the cosmos if you feel ignorance is ok and keep yourself in delusion you will be deluded about the cosmos also more and more clarity and understanding about your individual existence will help you have cosmic existence your present moment is not just what is happening to you it is your experience about yourself plus your experience about what is happening plus what is actually happening all 3 put together you always allow your perception about reality to impact your experience about yourself that is what i call powerlessness instead allowing your perception experience about yourself to impact your perception is what i call powerfulness power manifestation if you operate from these life positive things like joy bliss love even the chemicals and hormones your body secretes strengthens your immune system there are tons of researches to prove this every action you do from fear guilt anxiety the kind of hormones that get secreted breaks your nervous system and destroys your whole body and mind that is why i insist never ever operate out of powerlessness tough days teach you a lot i bought into all of it to the idea that there is no other way to be rich and successful but to work the hours and slave your life away to a stable job do not make any decision to execute any decision you made during pralaya because all those decisions are out of powerlessness when you were shaken and did not have trust on yourself now the healing and recovery is happening rebuild the love joy bliss powerfulness out of the new conscious being you are building with absolute life positivity take decisions influence now the present moment live in the present moment is not a complete truth have power over the present moment is the complete truth the power of now is having power over now deciding to cognize you are paramashiva because that is the truth om nithyananda paramashivoham and face your inner space your perception about life and life reality itself with this truth i am paramashiva this is what is having power over now reality life is superdeterminism neither predetermined nor free will it is superdeterminism empowering yourself with the truth reality that you are paramashiva the ultimate paramatma and from that truth reality making your perception about life and with the strength of that subjective truth about yourself and the world impacting the world reality is superdeterminism it remains one of the great inequalities of the world that some children are born light years ahead of others they may come from more stable homes from wealthy homes from homes with cleaners and domestic staff cooks and tutors everything is easier more streamlined more conducive to educational and career success others will come from one bedroom huts with no running water and no electricity little chance of a good education and little time to do anything besides work the child born into a rich family will no doubt progress at a faster rate and develop the sort of self assurance that comes from stability this is the case wherever you re from it is as true of communist societies as it is of capitalist ones i have travelled the world and seen these inequalities i have witnessed the problems such different starting blocks can bring but if i ve learned anything it is that success is possible whatever your situation and however your life begins i hope that this story my story will prove inspirational and that it will encourage others to dream big take a plunge use whatever resources are available if a small poor boy fishing for prawns on a lake in ningbo can do it then so can you if you begin to live with a little respect and love for existence and all its creations you will be able to recognize these things happening in your own life as well nature will simply reciprocate your love in manybeautiful ways very often love is confused with respect from a young age children are brought up to always show respect but never to show love you can hear people teach the children you should respect your elders you will hardly hear you should love your elders that is the problem love is the original religion it is the root of all spirituality all other religions are offshoots love is like the root of the tree and all religions are like leaves or branches even the greatest religions are only big branches compared to the religion of love an easy win is often a curse instead of a blessing because it develops a confident belief that so little fight is required to typically win which most often is not the likely case in life if there is a lot of you you be the victim if there is a lot of i you be the accuser accused both as with arrogrance profound balance life with we you are worthy of good things we all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime if you observevery closely whichever stage we are in when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person's attention when we say a person doesn't love us we actually mean that the other person doesn't give us enough attention the basic need for any human being is attention from others the attention need along with our dependency on others for survival is what we experience as love many people include certain people in their love list because these people give them a feel good feeling what do i mean by a feel good feeling it is a certificate saying you are good you are this you are that etc we love anyone who pays us compliments is it not we think twice before arguing with them wesecretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love if they go back on their approval of us we might fall into depression so we continue to please them and love them like this there is always some hidden reason for our love when you start possessing someone you bind yourself also if you are walking holding your dog's leash be very clear that you are also bound don't think only the dog is bound you are also bound don't think that only the dog cannot run away you too cannot run away you may be thinking that you are holding therope and the dog may be thinking that he is holding the rope who knows when love happens as causeless overflowing you simply liberate yourself and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness because possessiveness as you know it binds not only the other personbut you as well it tortures the other person as well as you real love simply liberates both of you it gives freedom to you and the other person with real love there will be no domination or power play in relationships each person will be like a beautiful flower that has blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance that's all being different doesn't mean being odd it means being unique what is meant by worry worry arises whenever things are not happening as you want them to happen it is the discrepancy between your expectations and reality everyone has his or her own set of worries if i ask you what you worry about you will tell me i don't have a job that's my worry your neighbor will say my job is my main worry someone else will say mychildren are my worry another person will say i don't have children that's my worry one person's dream is another person's worry you will not find any logic in it at all it is like this there is a continuous current of chatter happening in you twenty four hours a day seven days a week from this current a few spikes rise these spikes are what you feel and express as worries worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly moving within you joy never gets recorded as thoughts but pain does that's why our internal recordings are always negative thoughts joy is like a blank recording for example if your entire life is like a time shaft on that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces there won't be any recording corresponding to it but the moments of worry and suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions even when you see your husband wife brother or anyone look at them as though you are seeing them for thefirst time suddenly you realize that not only does worry not arise but also that you will start seeing everyone alike whether they are strangers or familiar to you that is the right way no one is familiar or unchanging even your wife is not known to you everyone is constantly changing every moment along with existence only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent ideas are worth nothing until belief persists the path to making our past right is layered by the future we write all the turbulences opens up the next level of your strength when you see what is as it is you are in heaven when you want to see what you want to see you are in hell if you understand that everything is auspiciousness you will drop expectation and see things as they are because everything is auspiciousness worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to children children are like sponges they simply absorb the body language and attitude of the parents the parents are not even aware this ishappening for example if a child hears the mother repeating a certain worry four or five times the child simply internalizes the habit he grows up repeating statements unnecessarily which is one attribute of worry the problem is that parents expect their children to worry if they don't worry they brand them as uncaring it is possible to care without worrying care is doing worry ischattering there is no use chattering chattering is like trying to cross a bridge before it comes awareness is nothing but bringing our focus to exactly what is happening in and around us it is witnessing anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve that is the power of awareness whether it is physicalpain mental pain worry or something else when we watch with awareness we stop the conflict somewhere within us we start moving with the natural flow of things when we watch worry with awareness we focus light on exactly how worry is created how it exists once this happens the anything that we watch with awareness will dissolve worry starts to dissolve and clarity starts happening it's more than fine to isolate yourself from toxic relationships and environments there's nothing wrong with it as long as it improves your life and lift your positive vibrations in life worries are the knots in the handkerchief if we look at them with awareness we will know how to dissolve them we will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to untie it the worry itself will teach us how to release it if you observe closely you will see that goals always create worry in us when we move toward any goal we move only with the worry about the results when you are worried about the results the very worry affects the results because when you worry your doing is affected work should always be done out of inspiration never out of worry if in trouble focus on where you want to be rather than where you are walk away from the negative darkness walk toward the positive lightsearch you amid the chaos everyday eating should not add weight or fat to your body it should be clearly digested and sent out that is what is health ferociousness means powerfully standing with the truth even if the whole world outside and your whole world inside tries to delude you and denies the reality the reality is you are paramashiva tamarind intake will help you to detox and de addict yourself from many addictions he said if you take a lot of tamarind your stomach will become very pure where no fermentation happens if you take a lot of water the body will become so pure there won't be water retention and its bad effects its better to stand out in a crowd than it is to blend into a crowdi do not intend to waste my life but to do great deeds to lose your way is easy it's finding your way back thats difficultall those negative vibes you let go of make more room for all those positive vibestreat any negativity as you would your trash throw it awaybecoming the best isn't in making ourselves the best but in making those around us even better without the knowledge of god there is no knowing use your strength to serve the lord your maker meditation is better than memorization the son of man is the messiah this too shall be passed if ignore the study of scriptures you will stumble in sin holding the ultimate truth powerfully inside you because it is the truth and lived by you because it is the truth not due to any utility is ferociousness as long as human beings are alive on planet earth they will have to work seek to manifest higher existence enlightenment paramashiva in them the growth and progress of life is all about expansion and all expansion is rejuvenation you not realizing the truth and feeling stuck cursing yourself and putting yourself in self doubt self hatred self denial is the only bad karma there is no external bad karma for everything you face in your life take this one scale how can i be life positive in this moment within me outside me with everyone involved the truth about the ultimate life positivity is one of the main reasons why hindus are constantly rejuvenating themselves and contributing to the world toss old chapters into the ocean let it fade eventually to erode write new chapters for the ink to soak in paper marking real glowing imprint of the present what woman wants she just wants to live her life freely on her own there could be no development without desire encounter any situation in life with deep love soon you will become pure love whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or anything just encounter it with deep love for love's sake existence is not a thing it is a living energy being every single tree every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate your every thought sometimes doing nothing makes way for everything there is very little difference between a philosopher and a lunatic if a lunatic talks a little well he is a philosopher and if a philosopher talks a little wrong he is a lunatic the fire of your imagination is stronger than your reality look back at your life it's like a river it has made its path till now it will make its path in future also don't fear keep flowing if you are a doctor think of health as the mission of your life then you will attract that kind of people around you manifest intense love for healing people treating curing people anyone who makes his creation as his mission not as just profession or career all the ashta aishwaryas and mahalakshmi will be with you take time to convince yourself that giving health is the mission of your life till the last breath then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant paramashivoham and reach kailasa that's it make your creation as a mission ashta lakshmis all the auspicious things will shower if you are a teacher then teaching is your creation decide teaching the whole world the subject you want to teach is your mission if you start thinking yourself as a mission the 25 heads of paramashiva will start manifesting in you this is a very important secret i went to arunagiri yogishwara once i remember very clearly there was a death in the tiruvannamalai village i told him about that important person in the village who died he smiled and said so casually he has reached kailasa and is waiting for next birth i asked him how you are able to take this flow so casually he smiled and said understand whatever exists outside exists inside whatever exists inside exists outside there is a death outside there is a death inside if you know how to understand the death dimension of you inside you will understand the death dimension outside you you have all the 25 dimensions in you after a few days of playing with the blindfolded archery he was asking me what is going on do you understand what i said i said yes swamiji i am trying to understand he put his hand on my head and asked me to do the same aiming at the goal with my eyes tied and his hand on my head initiation anupaya when i sent the arrow by the time the arrow hit the exact point my focus hit the oneness wherever you are be all therewhen you convince yourself when you click with the idea that you are larger than what you imagine as you you will feel so energetic healthy wealthy you will know aye i am not just a doctor i am a healer with a mission to heal i am not just a teacher i am an educator with a mission to educate make yourself larger than what society taught you if you understand even intellectually the existence of paramashiva that focus means not on one but on oneness it is enough this is exactly the way arjuna won the game the challenge and married draupadi this is exactly the science taught to rama by vashishta this is exactly the science taught to arjuna by drona this is the exactly the science taught to karna by parasurama i am giving you the pure hindu indian archery science if at all you have to eat something eat only guru's prasad now what i am giving is guru's prasad you are larger than what society has taught you click with it think intensely internalise there is nothing lacking in your life the only thing you need to have is the zeal of making your creation into a mission a fat person who is not able to keep himself awake alive fresh active not just kills his time but life itself because time is life time is the way we experience life the time available to you is the way you experience life if you want to remove all the negativity reduce food intake go for more vegetarianism and fruitarianism even if you live between vegetarianism and fruitarianism that is enough whenever you feel stuck and feel that something is not moving you are feeling frustrated irritated angry people are not listening to you loan is not happening health is not happening anything just sit and think what are the ways the dosage of love can be added into that situation that's it when you make your creation as a mission you will be showered with wealth and till the end you will have everything for you make life as a mission by your love about what you are doing intense life positivity intense life positivity intense life positivity with tremendous love activism life if you want health use the body intensely continuously everyday you will be healthy if you want peace keep your mind

you ferment bliss sustenance happens when you ferment ferociousness rejuvenation happens when you ferment powerful cognitions you are pulled out of delusion the throbhava energy happens in you when you allow the guru bhakti devotion or initiation to ferment in you liberation happens every person allows something to ferment in their system continuously sometimes you allow anger to get fermented sometimes you allow peace to get fermented sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented sometimes you allow fear to get fermented but continuously something or other is getting fermented in you that is the truth there is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you if you decide consciously to ferment bliss in you you will maintain everything in your life health wealth relationships mental health enlightenment state of paramashiva powers of paramashiva space being superconsciousness of paramashiva everything i will give you the scale to find out what you are

function perfectly all the detox will happen your liver is the real detoxifier it detoxes your system your life starts getting very active the liver's independent intelligence can be awakened by tamarind try to have tamarind juice or tamarind rice tamarind is the greatest purifier when the liver's independent intelligence is awakened it cleanses all the parasites sitting in the stomach and

dimension of me is putting in delusion and pulling out of delusion many times when you can't handle the reality as it is when you are not ready to be in that highest awareness space some things are kept out of your sight to reduce the stress for you to give you space to cope up with the reality it is better to be misunderstood than to make a mistake wait for god to what he desires to do for you the deeper the darkness the greater the need to seek divine deliverance from the only deliverer the divine being  the problem with gender inequality is that there are few who walk the talk masculinism and feminism are uncalled for when you can simply embrace humanism we should all be feminists till we successfully establish egalitarianism when you live for yourself you earn a living when you live for others you earn a life i had a humble birth but i am living for a glorious death amidst those random thoughts shines a bright idea awaiting to be born belief is flexible you can either make it your friend or your foe the ones who shined were the ones once undermined to know a great man is to know yourself i know that true knowing is to seek to know more his promises are his pledges my soul waiteth for the lord he is my helper only with confidence can you conquer the circumstance upanishad means sitting that's all just sitting we can give the meaning sitting at the feet of the master or sitting with the divine but the word upanishad means sitting that's all when you sit when you sit i don't say your body sits i am not saying your body sits when you sit truth is revealed when the rishis sat within them in samadhi their whole being started vibrating reverberating with the sacred truths the whole being started vibrating and reverberating with the sacred truths the cosmos started singing through them cosmos started radiating through them that expression is upanishads ganga ganga is responsible for upanishads i tell you the way she made that ganges valley rich all the basic needs she provided she supplied everything and fortunately there was no war no need for them to fight or defend all the natural energies were supporting all the needs are fulfilled and no need to fight for survival that ambience that space created such an amazing possibility such an amazing possibility such an amazing possibility that's a right word i ll use such an amazing possibility for them to sit within themselves with the cosmos with the universe with the nature the existence has started singing about itself through them when i say life i don't mean just breathing and staying alive i mean being alive at the innermost being level as a live consciousness if you can express love if you can experience love that is the only way of being alive as a consciousness if the cosmos is a grand ocean we are all part of it we are one with the ocean not individual drops in the ocean when we think of ourselves as individual drops we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings this is what is called ego as long as we remain a drop in the ocean we say no to life we neither love nor trust we don't feel blissful either because bliss is possible only for those who know how to love and trust it happens only to those who know how to feel part of the ocean bliss is possible only when our heart says yes when the no completely disappears from our being no is darkness yes is light no is ego yes is egolessness the way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean not to be a drop but to merge with the ocean to be a drop is to be a hindrance to be a drop is to be with ego the ego is the root of all misery when the ego is absent bliss reaches us from every nook and corner of the ocean of existence as if it were just waiting for the ego to disappear imagine a world without a woman truth is that aspect of our being that is right and secure in itself truth does not need the support of anything outside of itself truth is self referral this means that truth exists in reference to itself when a timeless leader relentlessly pursues the path of truth she is able to realize that all that she needs to know already exists in herself truthfulness makes a leader spontaneous like a a flowing river or a blazing fire such a leader is not caught in the mind's dogma or prejudices indeed truth is liberating it liberates both the leader and the follower the divine being is a divine blesser faith is never a fantasy each man destiny lies in his dreams dream new dreams daily love is an intense experience in one's inner space many of us think love is a choice we think experience and expression of love is a choice we think that if we want to we can handle love otherwise we can let it go no it is not a choice as we think it is a basic necessity of life humans are forever confused between love and lust they think only animals are lustful actually only animals are capable of pure lust when they mate humans with their rationalization can neither be lustful nor loving that is why they feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled krishna says in the bhagavad gita let you lift yourself by yourself if you don't you will be your worst enemy it is up to you to help yourself as your best friend or hurt yourself as your worst enemy be very clear nobody can hurt you unless you allow nobody can help you unless you allow you stay in the triumph of the past i will enjoy the nothingness of today surrender to your passions not to your circumstances big opportunities are rarein life it depends on youwhether you wait for one or you create one everything took it turn small and continuous effort can lead you to success you cannot win everyday but make sure you win at least once in a while fear is a deeper dimension of worry worry can cause ulcers fear on the other hand can even destroy life fear is a form of energy inside us that is why it cannot be destroyed energy can neither be created nor destroyed it can only be changed from one form to another just as darkness disappears automatically when light is brought into a room pain dissolves automatically when the energy of your awareness is focused on it add friendliness to love as of now our lust is deep rooted violence to possess the other person add friendliness to the relationship welcome the partner as he or she is do not just accept him or her welcome and accept the mind body and being as it is then you can see

the family you choose when you miss the family you lost they coverthose they want themselves of courseand other criminalslike them they sell an idealized lieto earn somethingand they throwthe others the innocents the pure the vulnerable the different they are not justice they are a cliqueby its own existence it expands into possibilities because of its existence and saying thathaasthuathmahana even while you are alive saying yesa mother shows mercy family is foundation of life first thing i felt so much of love and compassion when i decided to operate without any defence mechanism when someone is absolutely feeling secure he becomes the safest person to live around he gives security to everyone because he understands the value of being secure this science of healthy long living and the science of immortality not only it is reality it is easy just simple dietary change the things you eat the way you eat you need to change if we can detox you if the parasites microbes sitting inside your body and triggering you can be removed from your system then just proper diet is needed which is such a simple easy lifestyle in hindu tradition we know the science of making your brain grasp the whole cosmos the whole cosmic happening when i was developing the software for sarvajnatva means the power to know everything successfully i have also made many of my gurukul balasants manifest this power for a particular period of training all i needed to do was create an ecosystem inside and outside them where the brain does not feel tired or bored and by its own experience of its i ness existence it needs to be excited inspired experience atma ananda swaroopa ananda means what they think of themselves as their swarupa that itself is exciting inspiring if you start enjoying the narration you carry about you the swarupa ananda and everyone around you enjoys the narration about you in them which they carry in them in that space you manifest sarvajnattvadream new dreams faith set the heart of a man on fire in hindu tradition before removing the herb or root from the original plant they will do rituals called mooligai prana pratishtha meaning any curse or impurities on that herb the prana pratishtha will be done in such a way that even after the root is removed it will continue to have life in it a dead leaf cannot heal you only herbs with life can heal you on that herb the science of kayakalpa will be programmed when you take that in all the parasites sitting inside you which makes you addicted to food and activities which are not aligned to your kayakalpa all those parasites will be sent out of you you will be detoxed and free from those so automatically your thought currents lifestyle even desires will be aligned to your immortality to your kayakalpa the whole system needs to raise to that extreme powerful intelligent awareness you are not a living mechanism you are a living organism you have various internal organs like heart lungs brain stomach intestine liver kidney all these internal organs are centrally commanded administered and made to function in a coordinated way on certain principles all of them have certain understanding and principle among them that principle is called dharma so each one of you has a dharma inside you if you do little research you can see very clearly how your heart supports digestion how your digestive system supports detox how your kidney supports your lungs to function how your lungs supply prana to the whole body and keep you active alive energetic all of them work aligned to dharma to certain principles a very powerful superior independent intelligence is responsible for this whole organism if you can just sit unclutched you will understand that dharma you will be able to decode the software on which you are functioning you will see how the command to your lungs is passed what kind of command is given to your heart how your brain cognizes everything then your consciousness will automatically recognise the software coding based on which your organism is functioning you re stuck because you don't make enough mistakes if you never get off trail you never discover new landscapes understanding the problem helps in solving it so understand it instead of running away there is a powerful independent intelligence system inside you which is coordinating your whole existence how different internal organs are functioning and how they are interrelated to how you think and feel about you what kind of reaction reaction you experience in your life how life happens to you how you perceive life this whole science it happens in a very systematic way in you when you sit unclutched you will see clearly paramashiva is inside this kailasa is your body your heart is parashakti your gut is mahaganapati your lungs is nandi all his parivara devatas are your internal organs the independent intelligence consciousness with which he operates this whole kailasa is one team more and more unclutching you will catch the whole software coding why and when your heart is asked to pump more why and when your lungs are asked to breathe deep why and when your stomach is asked to digest fast why and when your bp is asked to be low why and when you experience stress in your brain why and when you experience peace this whole internal coding of your organism will be revealed to you when you sit unclutched if you know your dharma you will use the same to build your teamily you will know exactly who you should inspire who should be given fear who should be given greed who should be given inspiration who should be given love who should be given gifts who should be given punishment you will simply know the science of building your life if you know what is the code what kind of a methodology you use to coordinate your heart and lungs and brain how you inspire them keep them active alive healthy you ll simply know how to keep your business and family active alive healthy i want all of you to know

laid cannot be shaken 2 timothy 2 19i am for doing good to the poor but i differ in opinion of the means i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading or driving them out of it in my youth i traveled much and i observed in different countries that the more public provisions were made for the poor the less they provided for themselves and of course became poorer and on the contrary the less was done for them the more they did for themselves and became richer if you want the highs you have to go through the lows if baseless fears are giving you lows baseless hopes will give you highs if there is some substance in your lows there will be some substance in your highs being you never goes out of style learn to see thoughts go by with open eyes
